  abstract = {We investigated the neural processes involved in on-line statistical learning and word segmentation. Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants were exposed to continuous, nonlinguistic auditory sequences, the elements of which were organized into “tritone words” that were sequenced in random order, with no silent spaces between them. After listening to three 6.6-min sessions of sequences, the participants performed a behavioral choice test, in which they were instructed to indicate the most familiar tone sequence in each test trial by pressing buttons. The participants were divided into three groups (high, middle, and low learners) based on their behavioral performance. The overall mean performance was 74.4\%, indicating that the tone sequence was segmented and that the participants learned the tone words statistically. Grand-averaged ERPs showed that word onset (initial tone) elicited the largest N100 and N400 in the early learning session of high learners, but in middle learners, the word-onset effect was elicited in a later session, and there was no effect in low learners. The N400 amplitudes significantly differed between the three learning sessions in the high- and middle-learner groups. The results suggest that the N400 effect indicates not only on-line word segmentation but also the degree of statistical learning. This study provides insight into the neural mechanisms underlying on-line statistical learning processes.},

In order do determine the time course and neural processes involved in online word segmentation and statistical learning of visual sequence, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants were exposed to continuous sequences with elements organized into shape-words randomly connected to each other. After viewing three 6.6min sessions of sequences, the participants performed a behavioral choice test. The participants were divided into two groups (high and low learners) based on their behavioral performance. The overall mean performance was 72.2\%, indicating that the shape sequence was segmented and that the participants learned the shape-triplets statistically. Grand-averaged ERPs showed that triplet-onset (the initial shapes of shape-words) elicited larger N400 amplitudes than did middle and final shapes embedded in continuous streams during the early learning sessions of high learners, but no triplet-onset effect was found among low learners. The results suggested that the N400 effect indicated online segmentation of the visual sequence and the degree of statistical learning. Our results also imply that statistical learning represents a common learning device.},

  author = {Abrams, Lise},
  date = {1998},
  abstract = {Two experiments tested the hypothesis that orthographic overlap can affect word retrieval through inhibition and facilitation, analogous to effects observed in visual word recognition. Young and older adult participants rated a list of words for pleasantness, where the initial three letters of each word were orthographically identical for three words in the list (shared orthography) or were orthographically unique, shared by no other words in the list (unshared orthography). Word retrieval was assessed either explicitly via cued recall or implicitly via a word-stem completion test. Response times (RTs) were recorded in addition to the degree of correct recall and repetition priming, the standard retrieval measures in these tests. In explicit retrieval, orthographic overlap had no significant effect on RT, whereas correct cued recall was greater for words with shared orthography than for words with unshared orthography, and this increase in recall was the same for both age groups. There were age differences on both dependent measures, with older adults having slower RTs to recall words and less recall than young adults. In implicit retrieval, orthographic overlap significantly facilitated completion of word stems for both measures, evidenced by faster RTs and more repetition priming of shared orthography words than unshared orthography words, and these facilitation effects did not vary by age. Further, there were no overall age differences in RTs or in amount of repetition priming. Results suggest that orthographic overlap can facilitate word retrieval depending on the nature and measure of the retrieval. Both age and orthographic overlap dissociate implicit and explicit word retrieval, and these dissociations may be useful in clarifying theories of implicit and explicit memory and their relationships to language.

  abstract = {This research examined the function within lexical access of the main morphemic units from which most Arabic words are assembled, namely roots and word patterns. The present study focused on the derivation of nouns, in particular, whether the lexical representation of Arabic words reflects their morphological structure and whether recognition of a word involves recognition of its morphological constituents. The morphology of Arabic language constitutes two main systems: inflectional morphology and derivational morphology. Inflectional morphology is used to express grammatical relations and derivational morphology deals with the formation of new words in language; it contains two types of word patterns: verbal and nominal. In this study, it was assumed that roots are lexical entities that can facilitate lexical access to a large cluster of words that derive from them, whereas word patterns are not lexical entities and have no role in access to words assembled by them. The lexical representations of the main morphemic units were examined in four experiments using skilled readers applying masked priming technique tasks: lexical decision and naming. The results indicated that previous exposure to a word sharing the same word pattern had no marked facilitating effect on lexical decision or on naming. The main conclusion of this study on the morphology of Arabic is that roots and word patterns have no essential role in word organisation in the mental lexicon. In addition, words in nominal pattern in derivational morphology are represented in their whole shape in the mental lexicon and each word has an independent representation.

All 3 clinical groups differed from controls in memory for low-imagery as opposed to high-imagery words and in computational efficiency. A stepwise regression analysis to predict reading grade level showed age and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Revised (WISC–R) IQ to account for 38\% of the variance with an additional 28\% explained by the effortful task variables. It is theorized that ADD impedes automatization of number facts; and, inasmuch as RD children receive adverse attention ratings, even if not considered hyperactive, they, as well as ADD and HY/ADD boys, exhibit this deficiency.

They were found to vary widely on a measure of nervous system (NS) sensitivity recommended by A. N. Vasiler (1960). Ss were contrasted on their mean press and release RTs to 4 tones, ranging from soft (55 db) to loud (100 db), with the expectation that some would be able to maintain a parallel separation of press and release RT gradients across all intensity levels, and others would show convergence or overlap of the gradients at higher intensities. Contrary to expectation, girls did not have weaker or more sensitive NSs than boys, although girls rated themselves as less tolerant of intense stimuli. Significantly more of Ss diagnosed as hyperactive had weaker NSs. Boys also participated in a blind crossover study contrasting placebo and methylphenidate effects; the prescribing physician, who was not informed of the child's NS classification, adjusted the dosage levels so that Ss with weaker NS were titrated at higher dosage levels than those with stronger NSs. J. A. Gray (1964) suggested an explanation of the paradox (that the weak NS requires a more intense stimulus than the strong to reach the threshold of concentration, whereas for other thresholds the strong requires a more intense stimulus than the weak). Gray's theory was supported by the finding that Ss typed as weak did not show as great facilitation in RT with reward. (23 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

New chapter-ending The Big Picture sections with appropriate charts and tables encourage students to consider decisions about specific statistical analyses. Two separate chapters (Inferential Statistics and Comparing Your Sample to a Known or Expected Score) now allow instructors to focus on the theoretical concepts associated with inferential statistics before introducing each specific inferential statistic to enhance student understanding. Expanded coverage of inferential statistics includes more discussion of APA guidelines for appropriate statistics and more focus on effect sizes and confidence intervals.

Data analysis uncovered the principal forms of IBL, the features of each form, their characteristic educational objectives, and possible disciplinary variations. The findings show that underlying the diversity of language and tasks regarded as IBL there is a limited number of distinct task forms and a broad conception of inquiry that is shared by university teachers. The findings also indicate that IBL is practiced in a wide range of disciplines, in both undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs, in smaller and larger classes, and in universities which are more and less research intensive.},

  abstract = {The most frequently used words in English are highly ambiguous; for example, Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary lists 94 meanings for the word "run" as a verb alone. Yet people rarely notice this ambiguity. Solving this puzzle has commanded the efforts of cognitive scientists for many years. The solution most often identified is "context": we use the context of utterance to determine the proper meanings of words and sentences. The problem then becomes specifying the nature of context and how it interacts with the rest of an understanding system. The difficulty becomes especially apparent in the attempt to write a computer program to understand natural language. Lexical ambiguity resolution (LAR), then, is one of the central problems in natural language and computational semantics research.A collection of the best research on LAR available, this volume offers eighteen original papers by leading scientists. Part I, Computer Models, describes nine attempts to discover the processes necessary for disambiguation by implementing programs to do the job. Part II, Empirical Studies, goes into the laboratory setting to examine the nature of the human disambiguation mechanism and the structure of ambiguity itself.A primary goal of this volume is to propose a cognitive science perspective arising out of the conjunction of work and approaches from neuropsychology, psycholinguistics, and artificial intelligence--thereby encouraging a closer cooperation and collaboration among these fields.Lexical Ambiguity Resolution is a valuable and accessible source book for students and cognitive scientists in AI, psycholinguistics, neuropsychology, or theoretical linguistics.},

We propose a method that uses interaction between social network users to detect the most influential among them. We calculate the relationship strength and influence by capturing the frequency of interactions between users. We tested our model in a simulated social network of 150 users.

We previously proposed the Reverse Hierarchy Theory as a unifying concept that links behavioral findings of visual learning with physiological and anatomical data. Essentially, it asserts that learning is a top-down guided process, which begins at high-level areas of the visual system, and when these do not suffice, progresses backwards to the input levels, which have a better signal-to-noise ratio. This simple concept has proved powerful in explaining a broad range of findings, including seemingly contradicting data. We now extend this concept to describe the dynamics of skill acquisition and interpret recent behavioral and electrophysiological findings.},

Lastly, the comparison between the anomalous and conventional metaphor conditions shows bilateral activation in the middle frontal gyrus and the precentral gyrus, and right-hemisphere activation in the superior frontal gyrus. Left hemisphere activation is found in the inferior frontal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. The left hemisphere activation in the frontal and temporal gyri point to the recruitment of traditional language-based areas for anomalous metaphor sentences, while the right-hemisphere activation found suggests that remote associations are being formed. In short, our study supports the idea that metaphors are not a homogenous type of figurative language and that distinguishing between different types of metaphors will advance theories of language comprehension.},

These theoretical approaches suggest distinct roles for new neurons as they slowly integrate into the existing dentate gyrus network: immature adult-born neurons seem to function as pattern integrators of temporally adjacent events, thereby enhancing pattern separation for events separated in time; whereas maturing adult-born neurons possibly contribute to pattern separation by being more amenable to learning new information, leading to dedicated groups of granule cells that respond to experienced environments. We review these hypothesized functions and supporting empirical research and point to new directions for future theoretical efforts.

The findings suggest that speakers create a functional division between the two varieties by designating issues of importance, complexity, and seriousness to SA, the High code, and aligning less important, less serious, and accessible topics with DA, the Low code. The CS patterns therefore reproduce the unequal social values and distribution of SA and DA in the Arabic sociolinguistic landscape and simultaneously call for a reconceptualization of the notion of diglossia as presented in Ferguson's (1959) work. Other functions of CS as a marker of speakers' attitudes and as an index of pan-Arab or Muslim identities are discussed.

We propose a model that employs inductive learning to discover multiple rules, and assigns them confidence scores based on their performance in the lexicon. Our model is supported over the two alternatives by new "wug test" data on English past tenses, which show that participant ratings of novel pasts depend on the phonological shape of the stem, both for irregulars and, surprisingly, also for regulars. The latter observation cannot be explained under the dual mechanism approach, which derives all regulars with a single rule. To evaluate the alternative hypothesis that all morphology is analogical, we implemented a purely analogical model, which evaluates novel pasts based solely on their similarity to existing verbs. Tested against experimental data, this analogical model also failed in key respects: it could not locate patterns that require abstract structural characterizations, and it favored implausible responses based on single, highly similar exemplars. We conclude that speakers extend morphological patterns based on abstract structural properties, of a kind appropriately described with rules.

Another set of proposals questions whether inflected forms are generated by rule-based systems by connectionist type associative networks or if there is a dual system dissociating rule-based regular inflections from association-based irregular inflections. A central question is whether there are whole-word representations for regularly inflected forms. A series of five lexical decision experiments with 31 undergraduate students addressed this question by looking at whole-word frequency effects across a range of frequency values with constant stem-cluster frequencies. Frequency effects were only found for inflected forms above a threshold of about 6 per million, whereas such effects were found for morphologically simple controls in all frequency ranges. We discuss these data in the context of two kinds of dual models and in relation to competition models proposed within the connectionist literature.

Experiment 1 uses event-related potentials to examine noun-adjective number (present in L1) and gender agreement (absent in L1) in online sentence comprehension (receptive knowledge). For each feature, markedness was manipulated, such that half of the critical noun-adjective combinations were feminine (marked) and the other half were masculine; half were used in the plural (marked) and the other half were used in the singular. With this setup, we examined learners’ potential overreliance on unmarked forms or 'defaults' (singular/masculine). Experiment 2 examines similar dependencies in spoken sentence production (expressive knowledge). Learners (n = 22) performed better with number than gender overall, but their brain responses to both features were qualitatively native-like (i.e., P600), even though gender was probed with nouns that do not provide strong distributional cues to gender. In addition, variability with gender agreement was better accounted for by lexical (as opposed to syntactic) aspects. Learners showed no advantage for comprehension over production, and no systematic evidence of reliance on morphological defaults, although their online processing was sensitive to markedness in a native-like manner. Overall, these results suggest that there is facilitation for L2 properties that exist in the L1 and that markedness impacts L2 processing, but in a native-like manner. These results also speak against proposals arguing that adult L2ers have deficits at the level of the morphology or the syntax. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

That is, one member of the opposition (e.g. feminine for gender, plural for number) is assumed to be marked, and the other one, unmarked. The present study examines how these asymmetries impact agreement resolution in Spanish. Agreement was manipulated between a noun acting as head of a relative clause and an adjective located inside the relative clause (e.g. catedral que parecía inmensa “cathedral that looked huge”). Half of the nouns were feminine (marked) and the other half, masculine (unmarked). Half of the nouns were used in the plural (marked) and the other half, in the singular (unmarked). Twenty-seven Spanish native speakers read 240 sentences while their brain activity was recorded with electroencephalography and performed a grammaticality judgment. Results showed that both number and gender violations elicited a central-posterior P600, a component associated with syntactic repair, and a late anterior negativity, argued to reflect working memory costs. Only the P600 was affected by markedness. It started earlier for violations where the mismatching feature was marked. Moreover, it was larger for errors where the mismatching feature was marked, although this amplitude modulation only emerged for number, possibly due to differences in how number and gender cues were realized (i.e. both masculine and feminine showed overt inflection, but singular was uninflected relative to plural). These results suggest that the parser is sensitive to markedness asymmetries in the course of online processing.},

Cross-modal inflectional priming facilitates regular verbs but not irregular verbs. Similar but morphologically unrelated words inhibit each other when presented cross-modally. Based on this effect for formbased inhibition, the authors interpret the regular/irregular verb priming asymmetry as a reflection of competition between orthographically similar verb forms which results in target inhibition. The authors found that orthographically dissimilar irregular verbs show strong priming facilitation. The authors account for this result in terms of a two-level lexicon in which irregular verb alternates have distinct form-level entries, but engage a common entry at an abstract morphological level of representation. In addition to serving as evidence concerning the representation of English verbal inflection, the findings from these experiments also set important limits on the claim that the cross-modal priming paradigm automatically circumvents form-related processing effects that are not morphological in character.

  abstract = {Four experiments are reported that test a multistream model of visual word recognition, which associates letter-level and word-level processing channels with three known visual processing streams isolated in macaque monkeys: the magno-dominated (MD) stream, the interblob-dominated (ID) stream, and the blob-dominated (BD) stream (Van Essen \& Anderson, 1995). We show that mixing the color of adjacent letters of words does not result in facilitation of response times or error rates when the spatial-frequency pattern of a whole word is familiar. However, facilitation does occur when the spatial-frequency pattern of a whole word is not familiar. This pattern of results is not due to different luminance levels across the different-colored stimuli and the background because isoluminant displays were used. Also, the mixed-case, mixed-hue facilitation occurred when different display distances were used (Experiments 2 and 3), so this suggests that image normalization can adjust independently of object size differences. Finally, we show that this effect persists in both spaced and unspaced conditions (Experiment 4)—suggesting that inappropriate letter grouping by hue cannot account for these results. These data support a model of visual word recognition in which lower spatial frequencies are processed first in the more rapid MD stream. The slower ID and BD streams may process some lower spatial frequency information in addition to processing higher spatial frequency information, but these channels tend to lose the processing race to recognition unless the letter string is unfamiliar to the MD stream—as with mixed-case presentation.},

  abstract = {Five unmasked- and four masked-priming lexical decision experiments were carried out in Spanish in order to probe the data structures and processing routines that are exploited during the comprehension of inflected words. In unmasked priming, responses to targets (e.g., mor-os 'Moors') were inhibited when they were preceded by stem-homograph primes ( mor-ir 'to die') compared to unrelated control primes (sill-a 'chair'), and this inhibitory effect was over and above a weak inhibitory effect found for orthographic relative primes (moral 'moral'). Stem-homograph inhibition is interpreted as a consequence of morphological decomposition in lexical access. In additional experiments, this inhibitory effect was observed when targets were preceded by primes that were not themselves stem-homographic with the target, but rather were stem-allomorphic variants of the stem-homograph words (muer-e 'she/he/it dies'). Because target inhibition was found for primes whose inflectional stems are not strictly ambiguous in terms of form, it suggests that the inhibitory effect arises are encoded. The results observed in masked (subliminal) priming contrast with those observed in unmasked priming. When the primes were presented subliminally, stem-homograph priming (mor-ia - mor-os) was facilitative, while orthographic relative priming (moral - mor-os), was neither facilitative nor inhibitory. This was taken as further evidence that stems are decomposed at the form level, and that ambiguous decomposed stems, such as mor-, activate multiple (compatible) lemma representations during the initial stages of lexical access. Moreover, the facilitative effect observed in masked stem-homograph priming suggests that the lemma-level inhibitory mechanism implicated by stem-homograph allomorph priming should not be characterized in terms of built-in inhibitory links between certain lemmas, but rather as a mechanism that is invoked only when mutually exclusive lemma representations compete for selection as the interpretation for an ambiguous form. Furthermore, because stem-homograph priming was inhibitory when participants were aware of the primes, but facilitative when they were not, these priming results suggest that a single lemma interpretation for an ambiguous lexical form must be selected before that form can be consciously perceived as a meaningful word.

This may be evidence that the stem homograph effect is a direct consequence of morphological decomposition in lexical access.

This article reports evidence from 3 stem-homograph priming studies (n = 87 undergraduates) that implicate both morphological parsing and lexical selection processes at the lemma level. The authors argue that stem-homograph inhibition is the product of lexical selection mechanisms that are engaged just when a fully ambiguous stimulus (here, an inflectional stem) must be assigned one of its viable interpretations in order to afford conscious perception of lexical identity.

Experiment 1 replicated previous reports of repeated references to single antecedents eliciting greater N400 negativity than repeated references to conjoined antecedents within sentences, and extended these results to cross-sentence (discourse) references. Experiment 2 found that pronouns also elicited greater N400 negativity following single than conjoined antecedents. In both experiments, references to conjoined antecedents elicited greater frontal negativity than references to single antecedents in both sentences and discourse. Our results indicate that, in processing subject anaphors, the N400 is an index of reference predictability rather than a marker of the fit between antecedent salience and reference form, and that frontal negativity marks referential ambiguity elicited by conjoined phrases.},

The proposed theory views NP anaphor processing as an optimization process that is based on the principle that processing cost, defined in terms of activating semantic information, should serve some discourse function—identifying the antecedent, adding new information, or both. In a series of 5 self-paced reading experiments, anaphors' functionality was manipulated by changing the discourse focus, and their cost was manipulated by changing the semantic relation between the anaphors and their antecedents. The results show that reading times of NP anaphors reflect their functional justification: Anaphors were read faster when their cost had a better functional justification. These results are incompatible with any theory that treats NP anaphors as one homogeneous class regardless of discourse function and processing cost.

In two lexical decision experiments (n = 91), monosyllabic English words were presented, divided in between their first and second consonants (e.g., B LIND), at their onset-rime boundary (e.g., BL IND), or at their antibody boundary (e.g., BLI ND). Results indicated that the processes of infixation and reduplication did not affect the English word processing of native Filipino speakers. Rather, results for both native Filipino and native English speakers suggest that onsets composed of an "s /+ consonant' sequence (e.g., STAMP) are less cohesive than onsets comprised of a stop-liquid sequence (e.g., BLIND).

Event-related potentials were recorded to all items allowing for comparisons of the N400 component to repetitions within- and between-languages as well as to words presented for the first time. Three important findings were observed in this sample of participants during relatively early stages of acquiring a second language. First, in the typical N400 window (300-500 ms), between-language repetition produced a smaller reduction in N400 amplitude than did within-language repetition. Second, the time-course of between-language repetition effects tended to be more extended in time and differed as a function of language with L2-L1 repetitions language producing larger priming effects early and L1-L2 repetitions producing larger priming effects later (during windows after the typical N400). Third, a greater negativity in the ERP waveforms was observed when the word on the directly preceding trial was from the other language.

The results replicate the inhibitory effect of syllable–frequency obtained in several previous experiments in Spanish and offer support for an activational model incorporating a syllabic level. However, the authors argue that this type of model must incorporate sequential properties: both syllables activate lexical representations but they do not play exactly the same role, indicating a bias toward the 1st syllable.

Experiment 2 examined the role of both the BOSS frequency and the word frequency, also in a lexical-decision task. Syllable frequency was controlled. Both the BOSS frequency and the word frequency showed facilitatory effects.

We exploited a feature of several derived Italian words, that is, that they can be read in a “morphologically transparent” way or in a “morphologically opaque” way according to the sentence context to which they belong. This way, each target word was embedded in a sentence eliciting either its transparent or opaque interpretation. We analyzed whether the effect of stem frequency changes according to whether the (very same) word is read as a genuine derivation (transparent context) versus as a pseudoderived word (opaque context). Analysis of the first fixation durations revealed a stem-word frequency effect in both opaque and transparent contexts, thus showing that stems were accessed whether or not they contributed to word meaning, that is, word decomposition is indeed blind to semantics. However, while the stem-word frequency effect was facilitatory in the transparent context, it was inhibitory in the opaque context, thus showing an early involvement of semantic representations. This pattern of data is revealed by words with short suffixes. These results indicate that derived and pseudoderived words are segmented into their constituent morphemes also in natural reading; however, this blind-to-semantics process activates morpheme representations that are semantically connoted.

In Exps 2 (n=24) and 3 (n=24), targets were presented in an unfamiliar format or targets for which word/nonword discriminations were difficult. In Exp 4 (n=32), a prediction regarding the trade-off between processing efficiency and discounting the sense of familiarity to correctly classify a nonword target that follows a repetition prime was tested. It was demonstrated that masked priming of nonwords can be reliably produced, indicating that primes operate at a nonlexical level, primarily to facilitate orthographic encoding. The processing fluency created by a masked prime can work against correct classification of nonwords in a lexical decision task, leading either to no effect of priming or to an interference effect when Ss depend heavily on familiarity as a basis for lexical decisions. Materials used in the experiments are appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).},

A linear mixed-effects model was applied to single trial event-related potentials for 207 visually presented concrete words measured on total number of features (semantic richness), imageability, and number of visual motion, color, visual form, smell, taste, sound, and function features. Significant influences of multiple feature types occurred before 200ms, suggesting parallel neural computation of word form and conceptual knowledge during language comprehension. Function and visual motion features most prominently influenced neural activity, underscoring the importance of action-related knowledge in computing word meaning. The dynamic time courses and topographies of these effects are most consistent with a flexible conceptual system wherein temporally dynamic recruitment of representations in modal and supramodal cortex are a crucial element of the constellation of processes constituting word meaning computation in the brain.},

Fossil evidence shows apes, and early human ancestors were fruit eaters living in environments with strongly seasonal climates. Rapid cooling at the end of the Middle Miocene (15–12 Ma: millions of years ago) increased seasonality in Africa and Europe, and ape survival may be linked with a mutation in uric acid metabolism. Climate stabilized in the later Miocene and Pliocene (12–5 Ma), and fossil apes and early hominins were both adapted for life on ground and in trees. Around 2.5 Ma, early species of Homo introduced more animal products into their diet, and this coincided with developing bipedalism, stone tool technology and increase in brain size. Early species of Homo such as Homo habilis still lived in woodland habitats, and the major habitat shift in human evolution occurred at 1.8 Ma with the origin of Homo erectus. Homo erectus had increased body size, greater hunting skills, a diet rich in meat, control of fire and understanding about cooking food, and moved from woodland to savannah. Group size may also have increased at the same time, facilitating the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next. The earliest fossils of Homo sapiens appeared about 300 kyr, but they had separated from Neanderthals by 480 kyr or earlier. Their diet shifted towards grain-based foods about 100 kyr ago, and settled agriculture developed about 10 kyr ago. This pattern remains for many populations to this day and provides important insights into current burden of lifestyle diseases.},

In Experiment 1, the frequency of the first and second morpheme was manipulated in compound words of low whole word frequency. Experiment 2 compared pairs of low frequency compounds with high and low frequency first morphemes but identical second morphemes that were embedded in the same sentence frames. The results showed significant effects of the frequency of both morphemes on gaze duration and total fixation time on the compound words. Regression analyses revealed an influence of whole word frequency on the same measures. The results suggest that morphemic constituents of compound words are activated in the course of retrieving the representation of the whole compound word. The fact that the frequency effects were not confined to fixations on the morphemic constituents themselves implies that saccadic eye movements are implemented before morphemic retrieval has been completed. The results highlight the importance of developing more precise models of the perceptual processes underlying reading and how they interact with the processes involved in lexical retrieval and comprehension.},

The chapters in this book testify to the large, rich body of evidence that has been accumulated about visual word recognition in skilled readers. The uniformity assumption has served the field of visual word recognition well to this point. The chapters in these two volumes demonstrate that the accumulated evidence about how stimulus and task attributes influence average performance has made significant contributions to the development and refinement of theories of word recognition and reading. It was necessary to establish phenomena that can be robustly observed in average data before attempting to address nuances in its functioning. Many of the subtle effects of stimulus and task factors that have been established may have been difficult to tease out against the welter of individual differences in general cognitive capability and reading-specific skills that might potentially have been measured.

  abstract = {Reading is one of the most sophisticated demonstrations of human pattern recognition and symbolic processing skill. Skilled readers effortlessly comprehend written text at rates of at least 300 words per minute, despite the complex interactions between perceptual, cognitive and memory processes required for effective comprehension. Understanding how we achieve this remarkable feat has been a focus of investigation since the birth of experimental psychology. Over the last two decades, visual word recognition has been at the forefront of developments in cognitive science. This book brings together many of the most influential contributors to these developments to reflect on current issues in the cognitive science of lexical processing and the methods required for further progress. The first section focuses on computational models. Written words provide a fertile context for large-scale modeling and the domain of lexical retrieval has become a test-bed for evaluating competing theoretical frameworks. The later sections draw upon cognitive psychology, linguistics, philosophy, computer science and neuroscience to elaborate critical theoretical issues and to develop novel research tools.  From Inkmarks to Ideas provides advanced students and researchers with a comprehensive overview of the critical theoretical and empirical controversies in current research on the cognitive science of lexical processing and reading.},

Evidence for the precision and redundancy of skilled readers’ lexical representations is provided by investigations of the masked priming and rhyme judgment performance of university student readers categorized on reading comprehension and spelling performance. Lexical experts, defined by the combination of good reading and good spelling, were more efficient at lexical classification and more sensitive to orthographic–phonological relationships, but less susceptible to priming and interference from orthographically similar stimuli. Further experiments used rapid serial visual presentation sentence paradigms to investigate functional autonomy of skilled readers’ lexical retrieval. Better readers were more efficient at selecting the sentence-congruent meaning of a homographic word in a probe memory task but less susceptible to biasing sentence context when the task required accurate identification of sentence-incongruent words and nonwords. These findings support the view that better readers’ higher quality lexical representations allow them to more effectively integrate bottom–up and top–down information and tailor their processing to task demands.},

This experiment investigated this hypothesis by comparing the performance of adults classified on reading comprehension and spelling performance. ‘Lexical experts’, defined by above average performance on both measures, were compared with individuals who are good readers/poor spellers, poor readers/good spellers, or poor on both measures. Sentences finishing with a homograph (e.g., She danced all night at the ball) were followed by a probe word and participants had to decide whether it had occurred in the sentence. Critical probe words were related to either the sentence-congruous or the sentence-incongruous meaning of the homograph (e.g., waltz vs. throw). Lexical experts showed less interference from related probes than the other groups. When the sentences were presented at fast rates, poorer spellers showed interference for sentence-congruous but not sentence-incongruous probes. However, at slower presentation rates, all groups showed equivalent interference for both types of probes. The results support the lexical quality hypothesis by showing that high quality lexical representations, indexed by better spelling, are associated with reduced reliance on sentence context.},

Experiment 2, with 123 participants, replicated the finding of stronger inhibitory neighbor priming in better spellers using 5-letter words and distinguished facilitatory and inhibitory components of priming by comparing neighbor primes with ambiguous and unambiguous partial-word primes (e.g., crow\#, cr\#wd, crown CROWD).

The average data for 92 university students showed stronger priming effects for transparent than opaque or form pairs, due to a constant ‘headstart’ for related relative to unrelated pairs across the RT distribution. However, these average effects were significantly modulated by individual differences in independent measures of spelling and vocabulary. A ‘semantic profile’, defined by relatively higher vocabulary than spelling, was associated with robust priming for transparent pairs, particularly for slower responses, but little priming for opaque or form pairs. In contrast, individuals with an ‘orthographic profile’ of relatively higher spelling than vocabulary showed sustained priming for opaque pairs that was at least as strong as for transparently related pairs. This evidence of systematic individual differences amongst skilled readers has important implications for theories of lexical representation and processing.},

  abstract = {Masked priming is one of the most important paradigms in the study of visual word recognition, but it is usually thought to require a laboratory setup with a known monitor and keyboard. To test if this technique can be safely used in an online setting, we conducted two online masked priming lexical decision task experiments using PsychoPy/PsychoJS (Peirce et al., 2019). Importantly, we also tested the role of prime exposure duration (33.3 vs.~50 ms in Experiment 1 and 16.7 vs.~33.3 ms in Experiment 2), thus allowing us to examine both across conditions and within-conditions effects. We found that our online data are indeed very similar to the masked priming data previously reported in the masked priming literature. Additionally, we found a clear effect of prime duration, with the priming effect (measured in terms of response time and accuracy) being stronger at 50 ms than 33.3 ms and no priming effect at 16.7 ms prime duration. From these results, we can conclude that modern online browser-based experimental psychophysics packages (e.g., PsychoPy) can present stimuli and collect responses on standard end user devices with enough precision. These findings provide us with confidence that masked priming can be used online, thus allowing us not only to run less time-consuming experiments, but also to reach populations that are difficult to test in a laboratory.},

We trained 224 first-grade students on a small set of GPC regularities for vowels, embedded in words with either high or low consonant similarity, and tested their generalization to novel tasks and words.

Neural stem and progenitor cells are classified into several classes based on the different location of mitosis (apical or basal) and polarity features (bipolar, monopolar and non-polar). The polarized architecture of stem cells is linked to the asymmetric localization of proteins, mRNAs and organelles, such as the centrosome and the Golgi apparatus (GA). Polarity affects stem cell function and allows stem cells to integrate environmental cues from distinct niches in the developing cerebral cortex. The crucial role of polarity in neural stem and progenitor cells is highlighted by the fact that impairment of cell polarity is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia.},

Components relating to the stimulus encoding, retention and abstraction required for SL may include, but are not limited to, certain types of attention, processing speed and memory. It is likely that individuals vary in terms of the efficiency of these underlying components, and in patterns of connectivity among these components, and that SL tasks differ from one another in how they draw on certain underlying components more than others. This theoretical framework is of value because it can assist in gaining a clearer understanding of how SL is linked with individual differences in complex mental activities such as language processing. Variability in language processing across individuals is of central concern to researchers interested in child development, including those interested in neurodevelopmental disorders where language can be affected such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This paper discusses the link between SL and individual differences in language processing in the context of age-related changes in SL during infancy and childhood, and whether SL is affected in ASD. Viewing SL as a multi-component ability may help to explain divergent findings from previous empirical research in these areas and guide the design of future studies.

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how learning to read can be thought of as learning statistical regularities and to demonstrate why this is relevant for theory, modeling, and practice. This tutorial also shows how triangulation of methods and cross-linguistic research can be used to gain insight. Method The impossibility of conveying explicitly all of the regularities that children need to acquire in a deep orthography, such as English, can be demonstrated by examining lesser-known probabilistic orthographic cues to lexical stress. Detection of these kinds of cues likely occurs via a type of implicit learning known as statistical learning (SL). The first part of the tutorial focuses on these points. Next, studies exploring how individual differences in the capacity for SL relate to variability in word reading accuracy in the general population are discussed. A brief overview of research linking impaired SL and dyslexia is also provided. The final part of the tutorial focuses on how we might supplement explicit literacy instruction with implicit learning methods and emphasizes the value of testing the efficacy of new techniques in the classroom. The basic and applied research reviewed here includes corpus analyses, behavioral testing, computational modeling, and classroom-based research. Although some of these methods are not commonly used in clinical research, the depth and breadth of this body of work provide a compelling case for why reading can be thought of as SL and how this view can inform practice. Conclusion Implicit methods that draw on the principles of SL can supplement the much-needed explicit instruction that helps children learn to read. This synergy of methods has the potential to spark innovative practices in literacy instruction and remediation provided by educators and clinicians to support typical learners and those with developmental disabilities.},

  abstract = {There is little empirical evidence showing a direct link between a capacity for statistical learning (SL) and proficiency with natural language. Moreover, discussion of the role of SL in language acquisition has seldom focused on literacy development. Our study addressed these issues by investigating the relationship between SL and reading ability in typically developing children and healthy adults. We tested SL using visually presented stimuli within a triplet learning paradigm and examined reading ability by administering the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT-4; Wilkinson \& Robertson, 2006). A total of 38 typically developing children (mean age of 9;5 years, range 6;4–12;5) and 37 healthy adults (mean age of 21 years, range 18–34) were assessed. In children, SL was significantly related to reading ability. Importantly, this relationship was independent of grade and also age. The adult data, too, revealed that SL was significantly related to reading ability. A regression analysis of the combined child and adult data revealed that SL accounted for a unique amount of variance in reading ability, after age and attention had been taken into consideration. For the first time, this study provides empirical evidence that a capacity for more effective SL is related to higher reading ability in the general population.},

By contrast, no effect of neighborhood size and no neighborhood size x neighborhood frequency interaction were found. In Experiment 2, a facilitatory effect of neighborhood size on nonword naming was shown: Naming latencies were faster when nonwords had a large neighborhood. In the naming experiment, there was no effect of neighbors' frequency and no neighborhood size x neighborhood frequency interaction. An additional role for bigram frequency was found whereas syllable frequency did not give any independent contribution. These results further corroborate the view that, in a language with transparent orthography like Italian, despite a substantial contribution of sublexical print-to-sound mapping due to the language's high regularity/consistency, reading aloud of nonlexical material may benefit from the contribution of the lexical component.

Adaptation to the test illuminants was limited. The adjusted patch was surrounded by a single color (annulus display) or by many colors (Mondrian display). Observers either matched hue and saturation or made surface-color (paper) matches in which the subject was asked to make the test patch look as if it were cut from the same piece of paper as the standard patch. For two of the three subjects, the paper matches were approximately color constant. The hue–saturation matches showed little color constancy. Moreover, the illumination difference between the two displays was always visible. Our data show that simultaneous mechanisms alone (e.g., simultaneous color contrast) alter hues and saturations too little to produce hue constancy.},

The stimulus materials include exemplars of prototype categories (sport, vehicle, fruit, vegetable) previously studied by others, and also exemplars of supposedly well-defined categories (odd number, even number, female, and plane geometry figure). Experiment I, using these materials, replicated the exemplar rating experiment of Rosch (1973). It showed that both the well-defined and prototypic categories yield graded responses, the supposed hall-mark of a family resemblance structure. Experiment II, using the same sorts of stimulus materials, replicated a verification-time paradigm, also from Rosch (1973). Again, the finding was that both well-defined and prototypic categories yielded results previously interpreted to support a family-resemblance description of those categories, with faster verification times for prototypical exemplars of each category. In Experiment III, new subjects were asked outright whether membership in the category of fruit, odd number, etc., is a matter of degree, or is not, and then these subjects were rerun in the Experiment I paradigm. Though subjects judged odd number, etc., to be well-defined, they provided graded responses to all categories once again. These findings highlight interpretive difficulties for the experimental literature on this topic. Part I of the discussion first outlines a dual theory of concepts and their identification procedures that seems to organize these outcomes. But Part II of the discussion argues that feature theories are too impoverished to describe mental categories, in general.},

  abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to examine the on-line processing mechanisms used by young children to comprehend pronouns. The work focuses on their use of two highly relevant sources of information: (1) the gender and number features carried by English pronouns, and (2) the differing accessibility of discourse entities, as influenced by order-of-mention in a clause. Adults use both evidential sources, as early as 200 ms after the offset of the pronoun (Arnold, Eisenband, Brown-Schmidt, \& Trueswell, 2000). We find that like adults, 3–5-year-old children use a pronoun's gender to guide their choice of a referent, and that they use it rapidly on-line. But unlike adults, they show little or no signs of a first-mentioned bias, either off-line or on-line. This is consistent with a tendency for children to initially recruit reliable sources of constraint for language comprehension – in this case, the gender of the pronoun.},

How do listeners identify whether “they” has a singular or plural sense? We test the role of explicitly discussing pronouns (e.g., “Alex uses they/them pronouns”). In three experiments, participants read short stories, like “Alex went running with Liz. They fell down.” Answers to “Who fell down” indicated whether participants interpreted they as Alex or Alex-and-Liz. We found more singular responses in discourse contexts that make Alex more available: when Alex was either the only person in the context or mentioned first. Critically, the singular interpretation was stronger when participants heard explicit instructions that Alex uses they/them pronouns, even though participants in all conditions had ample opportunity to learn this fact through observation. Results show that the social trend to talk about pronouns has a direct impact on how language is understood.},

Most believe that the meanings of words are similarly compositionally derived from the meanings of their constituent morphemes. The classical lexicalist hypothesis holds instead that the central basic meaningful constituents of language are not morphemes but lexemes. This article supports that hypothesis with evidence from syntax, lexical semantics, \& morphology. Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL) is a new language that is compositional down to its smallest pieces, in which these pieces are lexemes. ABSL shows that a language can emerge very quickly in which lexemes are basic. Next comes evidence against the claim that newly derived words diverge from compositionality only because they are stored in memory. Finally, Hebrew verb roots are shown to have robust morphological properties that bear no relation to meaning \& little to phonology, leaving room for morphemes within a lexeme-based framework, but not as the basic meaningful atoms of language.

  abstract = {According to one widely accepted view (Aronoff 1976, 1982), the morphology of a language, because it is part of grammar and trades in structural matters, deals primarily with the internal structure of the potential complex words of a language. These words may not all exist, but they all conform to the morphological structure of the language. By contrast, the lexicon of a language is a list of existing items in the language, those that a speaker has to know because they are arbitrary signs: unpredictable in some way. Most of the items on this list are words, though the lexicon also contains larger units like idioms, and maybe also smaller units like affixes. On this view, in which the regular morphology and the irregular lexicon are separate entities, one might imagine the two having very little to do with one another, since the morphology deals only with potential words and the lexicon only with existing words. In fact, the two systems do have a great deal to do with one another, for two simple reasons. The first is that they serve the same role in a language: both provide words. This overlap has even led some linguists to say that morphology is “in the lexicon” (Jensen and Stong-Jensen 1984), although in doing so, these linguists are using the term lexicon in a much broader and different sense, to mean the source of all words, actual and potential, rather than in the narrow sense of a list of unpredictable items that we have inherited from traditional grammar and from Bloomfield (Bloomfield 1933, Zwicky 1989, Aronoff 1994). The second reason is that morphology and the lexicon are interdependent. Most centrally, the morphology, which forms words from words, finds the words that it operates on (its bases) in the lexicon. We will explore each of these interrelations in a separate section.},

  abstract = {In alphabetic writing systems, the most consistent correspondences hold between written and spoken segments. Although English spelling uses the Roman alphabet and is thus largely phonographic, it also encodes non-phonological distinctions such as those among homophonic words (e.g., pair, pare, pear). We review evidence that English spelling is to some extent morphographic at the level of suffixes: some suffixes (e.g. -s and -ed) have a single constant spelling (‹-s› and ‹-ed›), despite the fact that they vary in phonological realization (-s is realized as [z], [s], or [əz], depending on the preceding segment); while other suffixes (e.g. -ic) are spelled differently from homophonous word-final phonological sequences (e.g. ‹relic› vs. ‹relick›). We explore the implications of our research for psycholinguistic findings on morphological processing of written English, with a special focus on 'affix stripping' processes. Psycholinguistic research has largely assumed the straightforward linguistic validity of morphographic spelling, without appreciating either its typologically unusual nature or the subtle and complex relation that it bears to morphology, phonology, and semantics.},

  abstract = {A fundamental goal of the human auditory system is to map complex acoustic signals onto stable internal representations of the basic sound patterns of speech. Phonemes and the distinctive features that they comprise constitute the basic building blocks from which higher-level linguistic representations, such as words and sentences, are formed. Although the neural structures underlying phonemic representations have been well studied, there is considerable debate regarding frontal-motor cortical contributions to speech as well as the extent of lateralization of phonological representations within auditory cortex. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis to investigate the distributed patterns of activation that are associated with the categorical and perceptual similarity structure of 16 consonant exemplars in the English language used in Miller and Nicely's (1955) classic study of acoustic confusability. Participants performed an incidental task while listening to phonemes in the MRI scanner. Neural activity in bilateral anterior superior temporal gyrus and supratemporal plane was correlated with the first two components derived from a multidimensional scaling analysis of a behaviorally derived confusability matrix. We further showed that neural representations corresponding to the categorical features of voicing, manner of articulation, and place of articulation were widely distributed throughout bilateral primary, secondary, and association areas of the superior temporal cortex, but not motor cortex. Although classification of phonological features was generally bilateral, we found that multivariate pattern information was moderately stronger in the left compared with the right hemisphere for place but not for voicing or manner of articulation.},

Prefixes and suffixes provide morphological information concerning meaning and/or function of the word stem. There is some empirical support for the hypothesis that these sublexical access units are functionally involved in the process of word recognition. These studies focus on the role of prefixes as access units in visual word recognition. Adult readers and children were presented a lexical decision task using polysyllabic word and nonword items. Prefix Frequency (high/low) and Quality (true/pseudo prefix ratio) were manipulated. Evidence was found for differential use of prefix information in both groups. Characteristic difference patterns between skilled and less skilled readers are discussed. It is concluded that the information accessed by prefixes is semantically combined with the subsequent word stem (root). Characteristics of the prefix plus stem combination largely determine speed of access to the complex word item processed. The results are compared to those of A. Laudanna et al (1994) with the Italian language. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) The importance of language for theory of mind, and more specifically for belief ascription, has become increasingly apparent during recent years. Language is important in many ways for many reasons, as the chapters in this volume clearly show. In this chapter the authors discuss the question of why language matters for the development of false-belief understanding in particular. "Language" is a broad term-different structural aspects as well as different functions fall under the scope of the term, and therefore it is important to first be precise about the aspects of language to which this chapter is referring. In the introduction (Astington \& Baird, this volume, chapter 1), the authors make two orthogonal distinctions. The first is a functional distinction, between language as an intra-individual representational system, on the one hand, and language as an inter-individual communication system, on the other. The second distinction is made at a structural level between language in general and mentalistic language in particular. With reference to the first distinction, the focus in this chapter is on language as an internal, representational system that can support the development of false-belief understanding. With reference to the second, the authors focus on the role of language in general until the final section of the chapter, when attention is shifted to mentalistic language in particular.

  abstract = {(from the jacket) Recently, work from leading researchers has demonstrated a strong relationship between theory of mind and language development. In this volume, these researchers give their answers to the fundamental question: Why does language matter for theory of mind? Theory of mind requires awareness of other peoples mental states-beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions-that are revealed largely through conversation. As their language skills develop, children are able to take part in conversation, and it is this experience that allows them to acquire concepts of mental states and to master the syntax for representing them. For theory of mind to develop, children need both the social environment that provides the input and their own cognitive resources that make use of it. This volume is a state-of-the-art account of the latest conceptual and empirical advances in children's theory of mind. The contributors consider the links between theory of mind and language from both communicational and representational perspectives because language serves both of these different functions-that is, social communication in conversation and internal, verbal representation. They also present research from a variety of populations-typically developing children, children with autism, and deaf children. The result is a kaleidoscopic view of the complexity of the relationship between language and theory of mind that provides a variety of answers to the question of why language matters for theory of mind.

Following Leonardo's own unique model, Atalay searches for the internal dynamics of art and science, revealing to us the deep unity of the two cultures. He provides a broad overview of the development of science from the dawn of civilization to today's quantum mechanics.

  abstract = {The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 ± 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells (“neurons”) and 84.6 ± 9.8 billion NeuN-negative (“nonneuronal”) cells. With only 19\% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82\% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.

  abstract = {A 2-layer symbolic network model based on the equilibrium equations of the Rescorla–Wagner model (Danks, 2003) is proposed. The study first presents 2 experiments in Serbian, which reveal for sentential reading the inflectional paradigmatic effects previously observed by Milin, Filipović Đurđević, and Moscoso del Prado Martín (2009) for unprimed lexical decision. The empirical results are successfully modeled without having to assume separate representations for inflections or data structures such as inflectional paradigms. In the next step, the same naive discriminative learning approach is pitted against a wide range of effects documented in the morphological processing literature. Frequency effects for complex words as well as for phrases (Arnon \& Snider, 2010) emerge in the model without the presence of whole-word or whole-phrase representations. Family size effects (Moscoso del Prado Martín, Bertram, Häikiö, Schreuder, \& Baayen, 2004; Schreuder \& Baayen, 1997) emerge in the simulations across simple words, derived words, and compounds, without derived words or compounds being represented as such. It is shown that for pseudo-derived words no special morpho-orthographic segmentation mechanism, as posited by Rastle, Davis, and New (2004), is required. The model also replicates the finding of Plag and Baayen (2009) that, on average, words with more productive affixes elicit longer response latencies; at the same time, it predicts that productive affixes afford faster response latencies for new words. English phrasal paradigmatic effects modulating isolated word reading are reported and modeled, showing that the paradigmatic effects characterizing Serbian case inflection have crosslinguistic scope.

Classical methodological considerations pertaining to the statistical analysis of RT data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., Forster \& Dickinson, 1976). Mixed-effects modeling (see, e.g., Baayen, Davidson, \& Bates, 2008) does not require prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. Mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. In this study, we argue for empirical exibility with respect to the choice of transformation for the RTs. We advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. We also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal dependencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. These strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. Special attention is paid to the evaluation of interactions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.},

  abstract = {This study examines the productivity of five English derivational affixes in a British newspaper, the Times (London), in the period from September 1989 to December 1992. This diachronic corpus of roughly 80 million word tokens contains large numbers of neologisms. Thus, this corpus offers a good opportunity to test both qualitative and quantitative theories of morphological productivity. Our investigations support the usefulness of the quantitative formalization of the notion DEGREE OF PRODUCTIVITY developed in Baayen 1992, 1993a. At the same time, they illustrate that productivity is a function of both text type and real time. An investigation of the morphological structure of the neologisms provides strong support for Aronoff's (1976) claim that the productivity of an affix may vary significantly with the morphological structure of the base word to which it attaches.},

One goal of the study was to replicate and expand upon findings suggesting facilitative effects of morphological relatives of a target word. A second goal was to demonstrate the need for a reinterpretation of root and surface frequency effects, which traditionally have been taken as indicators of parsing-based and memory-driven processing, respectively. In a first study, we used the same stimuli across auditory and visual lexical decision and naming. Mixed-effects statistical modeling revealed that surface frequency was a robust predictor of RTs even in the very low end of the distribution, but root frequency was not. Also, the nature of the similarity between a target and its lexical competitors is crucial. Measures gauging the influence of morphological relatives of the target were facilitative, while measures gauging the influence of words related only in form were inhibitory. A second study analyzing data from the English Lexicon Project, for a large sample of words from across the full frequency range, supports these conclusions. An information-theoretical analysis of root and surface frequency explains why surface frequency must be the most important predictor, with only a marginal role for root frequency.},

Second, the type count of the number of compounds and derived words in which a given simplex noun appears as a constituent also affects our experimental measures. We offer an explanation of these results in terms of the semantic differences between noun pluralization as inherent inflection on the one hand, and derivation and compounding on the other.},

It is well known that word formation processes are subject to various syntagmatic conditions. Booij (1977) develops a typology of such conditioning factors, distinguishing between rule-specific and rule-independent restrictions on the one hand, and between restrictions pertaining to phonological, stratal and syntactic characteristics on the other.1 The rôle of pardigmatic factors is discussed in van Marie (1985). He points out that (roughly) synonymous affixes tend to select their base words from complementary domains. Hence they can be analyzed as mutually affecting their respective degrees of productivity.},

Previous studies of stem-homograph priming report inhibitory effects for unmasked primes. The authors demonstrate that whereas unmasked stem-homograph primes elicit inhibitory effects, masked primes elicit facilitation relative to both orthographic and unrelated controls. It was hypothesized that this inhibition is a (sub)component of the selection process that is engaged when a fully ambiguous lexical stimulus (here the inflectional stem of a stem homograph) must be assigned a unique interpretation in order to afford conscious perception/recognition. The authors' analysis highlights the interdependency between lexical parsing and the inhibition mechanisms observed during word recognition.

Previous studies held that structural conditions on coreference work as interpretive filters that impose exceptionless limits on which antecedent candidates can be evaluated by subsequent, content-based processes. These experiments instead support an interactive-parallel-constraint model, in which multiple weighted constraints (including constraints on binding) simultaneously influence the net activation of a candidate during preselection stages of antecedent evaluation. Accordingly, structurally inaccessible candidates can interfere with antecedent selection if they are both prominent in focus structure and gender-number compatible with the pronoun or anaphor.

Following the principles of inflection, the distribution of these allomorphs is determined by competition. This view is in sharp contrast to the long-standing assumption that derivational suffixes convey not only morpho-syntactic, but also semantic information. In this article, a detailed analysis of two functionally similar English suffixes, -ness and -ity, will show that the distributionalist view is too vague as it stands because it misses subtle but significant semantic differences between these suffixes, which result from their historical development. On the basis of doublets such as ethnicness versus ethnicity, or sincereness versus sincerity it will be argued that -ness and -ity are not in complementary distribution, but select different domains of their adjectival bases. Evidence for this hypothesis is drawn from various morphological phenomena and a variety of data.},

  abstract = {The initial process of identifying words from spoken language and the detection of more subtle regularities underlying their structure are mandatory processes for language acquisition. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that allow us to extract these two types of information and their specific time-course of acquisition following initial contact with a new language. We report time-related electrophysiological changes that occurred while participants learned an artificial language. These changes strongly correlated with the discovery of the structural rules embedded in the words. These changes were clearly different from those related to word learning and occurred during the first minutes of exposition. There is a functional distinction in the nature of the electrophysiological signals during acquisition: an increase in negativity (N400) in the central electrodes is related to word-learning and development of a frontal positivity (P2) is related to rule-learning. In addition, the results of an online implicit and a post-learning test indicate that, once the rules of the language have been acquired, new words following the rule are processed as words of the language. By contrast, new words violating the rule induce syntax-related electrophysiological responses when inserted online in the stream (an early frontal negativity followed by a late posterior positivity) and clear lexical effects when presented in isolation (N400 modulation). The present study provides direct evidence suggesting that the mechanisms to extract words and structural dependencies from continuous speech are functionally segregated. When these mechanisms are engaged, the electrophysiological marker associated with rule-learning appears very quickly, during the earliest phases of exposition to a new language.},

The authors advocate viewing mental-state concepts as emerging in the context of social and linguistic interaction. The purpose of this chapter is to pursue this issue as a specific case of Gentner and colleagues' (e.g., Gentner \& Medina, 1998) general proposal that language is a catalyst for abstraction in part because it serves as an aid to analogical reasoning and inductive inference. The authors' hypothesis is that language invites one to compare people's behavior across distinct action scenarios, thereby helping to highlight commonalities, foster attention to relevant differences, and promote inferences about non-obvious sources of commonality and difference. The authors delve into the process of mentalistic abstraction, wherein ideas are formed to explain notions such as belief, desire, and intention. The authors provide a far-from-comprehensive sketch of Gentner et al's conceptualization of analogical reasoning, followed by brief coverage of findings indicating that language facilitates analogical reasoning. With this background established, the chapter turns to applying these ideas to the case of present interest: construction of mentalistic concepts.

An examination of recent scholarship as well as the historical record reveals that the origins of this usage rest in the fourteenth century and that its frequency has increased since then. Using current theories of agreement, the author presents a hypothesis for how and when this pattern could have entered the language. Further examination of the historical record supports the hypothesis that loss of grammatical gender in the thirteenth century was crucial for the introduction of generic they into the language.}

  abstract = {Two auditory lexical decision experiments document for morphologically complex words two points at which the probability of a target word given the evidence shifts dramatically. The first point is reached when morphologically unrelated competitors are no longer compatible with the evidence. Adapting terminology from Marslen-Wilson (1984), we refer to this as the word’s initial uniqueness point (UP1). The second point is the complex uniqueness point (CUP) introduced by Balling and Baayen (2008), at which morphologically related competitors become incompatible with the input. Later initial as well as complex uniqueness points predict longer response latencies. We argue that the effects of these uniqueness points arise due to the large surprisal (Levy, 2008) carried by the phonemes at these uniqueness points, and provide independent evidence that how cumulative surprisal builds up in the course of the word co-determines response latencies. The presence of effects of surprisal, both at the initial uniqueness point of complex words, and cumulatively throughout the word, challenges the Shortlist B model of Norris and McQueen (2008), and suggests that a Bayesian approach to auditory comprehension requires complementation from information theory in order to do justice to the cognitive cost of updating probability distributions over lexical candidates.

Although the same set of words was used in each task, the relationship of the lexical variables to RT varied significantly with the task within which the words were embedded. The effect of word frequency was minimal in the category verification task, whereas it was significantly larger in the pronunciation task and significantly larger yet in the lexical decision task. It is argued that decision processes having little to do with lexical access accentuate the word-frequency effect in the lexical decision task and that results from this task have questionable value in testing the assumption that word frequency orders the lexicon, thereby affecting time to access the mental lexicon. A simple 2-stage model is outlined to account for the role of word frequency and other variables in lexical decision. The model is applied to the results of the reported experiments and some of the findings in other studies of lexical decision and pronunciation.

Word recognition research is central to notions regarding different levels/codes of analysis in language processing, attention, and memory. The lexical unit is ideally suited for such work because words can be analyzed at many different levels—for example, features, letters, graphemes, phonemes, morphemes, and semantics. Word recognition research is also central in the development of theories of automatic and attentional processes. Part of the reason for this emphasis is the natural relation between the development of reading skills and the development of automaticity. One can see the extra impetus from education circles regarding the development of word recognition skills. Moreover, the notion that the aspect of word recognition has been automatized and is no longer under the conscious control of the reader has historically provided some of the major fuel for arguments regarding self-encapsulated linguistic processing modules. The issue of how attentional control signals might modulate processes involved in word recognition has received renewed interest recently, and hence, notions of automaticity and modularity have been reevaluated.},

We review simple procedures for capturing characteristics of underlying RT distributions and show how such procedures have recently been useful to better understand effects from standard cognitive experimental paradigms and individual differences in performance. These well-studied procedures for understanding RT distributions indicate that effects in means can be produced by (a) shifts of RT distributions, (b) stretching of slow tails of RT distributions, or (c) some combination. Importantly, effects in means can actually be obscured by opposing influences on the modal and tail portions of RT distributions. Such disparate patterns demand novel theoretical interpretations.},

Adult neurogenesis has been widely studied by labeling, with tritiated thymidine or its analog BrdU, cells duplicating their DNA in anticipation of their last mitotic division and following their fate as new neurons. New methods based on endogenous markers of cell cycling or of various stages of neuronal life have allowed for additional progress. In particular immunocytochemical visualization of the microtubule-associated protein doublecortin has provided an integrated view of neuronal replacement in the song control nucleus HVC. Multiple questions remain however concerning the specific steps in the neuronal life cycle that are modulated by various factors and the underlying cellular mechanisms.},

  abstract = {A large body of electrophysiological literature showed that metaphor comprehension elicits two different event-related brain potential responses, namely the so-called N400 and P600 components. Yet most of these studies test metaphor in isolation while in natural conversation metaphors do not come out of the blue but embedded in linguistic and extra-linguistic context. This study aimed at assessing the role of context in the metaphor comprehension process. We recorded EEG activity while participants were presented with metaphors and equivalent literal expressions in a minimal context (Experiment 1) and in a supportive context where the word expressing the ground between the metaphor’s topic and vehicle was made explicit (Experiment 2). The N400 effect was visible only in minimal context, whereas the P600 was visible both in the absence and in the presence of contextual cues. These findings suggest that the N400 observed for metaphor is related to contextual aspects, possibly indexing contextual expectations on upcoming words that guide lexical access and retrieval, while the P600 seems to reflect truly pragmatic interpretative processes needed to make sense of a metaphor and derive the speaker’s meaning, also in the presence of contextual cues. In sum, previous information in the linguistic context biases towards a metaphorical interpretation but does not suppress interpretative pragmatic mechanisms to establish the intended meaning.},

This observation has been brought under systematic scrutiny by laboratory studies measuring interference with memory performance during exposure to irrelevant sound. These studies established that the degree of interference depends on the properties of the irrelevant sound as well as those of the cognitive task. The way in which this interference increases or diminishes as characteristics of the sound and of the cognitive task are changed reveals key functional characteristics of auditory distraction. A number of important practical implications that arise from these studies are discussed, including the finding that relatively quiet background sound will have a marked effect on efficiency in performing cognitive tasks.},

Is this regularization due to a semantic difference from the usual verb, or is it due to the application of the default rule, namely VERB + -ed suffix? In Experiment 1, participants rated the semantic similarity of the extended senses of polysemous verbs and denominal verbs to their central senses. Experiment 2 examined the acceptability of the regular and irregular past-tenses of the different verbs. The results showed that all the denominal verbs were rated as more acceptable for the regular inflection than the same verbs used polysemously, even though the two were semantically equally similar to the central meaning. Thus, the derivation of the verb (nominal or verbal) determined the past-tense preference more than semantic variables, consistent with dual-route models of verb inflection.},

Recent research, however, shows that content and process cannot be neatly segregated, because cultural differences in what people think affect how people think. To achieve a deeper understanding of the relation between process and content, research must integrate the methodological insights from both anthropology and psychology. We review previous research and describe new studies in the domain of folk biology which examine the cognitive consequences of different conceptualizations of nature and the place of humans within it. The focus is on cultural differences in framework theories (epistemological orientations) among Native Americans (Menominee) and European American children and adults living in close proximity in rural Wisconsin. Our results show that epistemological orientations affect memory organization, ecological reasoning, and the perceived role of humans in nature. This research also demonstrates that cultural differences in framework theories have implications for understanding intergroup conflict over natural resources and are relevant to efforts to improve science learning, especially among Native American children.},

In priming tasks, stem homographs produce inhibition, unlike morphologically related words (loca/loco (madwoman/madman)) which produce facilitation. An event-related potentials study was conducted to compare morphological and stem homographic priming effects. The results show a similar attenuation of the N400 component at the 350–500 ms temporal window for the two conditions. In contrast, a broad negativity occurs only for stem homographs at the 500–600 ms window. This late negativity is interpreted as the consequence of an inhibitory effect for stem homographs that delays the stage of meaning integration.},

We believe that neurophysiological (especially, although not limited to electrophysiological) data can serve an essential reference in the development of biologically realistic models of reading.

Results showed that, while high frequency words produced less negative amplitudes in the N400 time window than low frequency words, the inverse pattern was found for syllable frequency. Words containing high frequency syllables produced more negative amplitudes than words containing low frequency syllables. Importantly, a significant syllable frequency effect was also obtained at the P200 time window. The results are interpreted in the framework of an interactive activation model, in which high frequency syllables produce the initial activation of a larger number of lexical candidates during the analysis of orthographic or phonological representations, which have to be inhibited later to allow the identification of a unique word. These findings support the idea that, at least in languages with clear syllabic boundaries, syllables are functional sublexical units during visual word recognition.

The study of tense-aspect morphology has been the focus of many descriptive and pedagogical accounts of language. This book has 3 goals: to describe the acquisition of temporal expression, to examine how we study the acquisition of temporal expression in second language, and to consider research methods and analysis as they have been used in the study of second language temporality. The development of temporality is amenable to study through production data. This field of inquiry is dominated by learner-generated texts. There have been some experimental studies done that balance the production of learners among different types of verbs, and these have confirmed the patterns that have been observed in freer learner production.

Data indicated that (a) behavioral accuracy was almost perfect for all the experimental tasks, and (b) although P200 and N400 ERP components were elicited in the experimental tasks, the latencies of those components were significantly longer and their amplitudes significantly higher in the phonological task. Variations in vowel information had no effect on word recognition in either type of task. The results suggest that among skilled readers of Hebrew, phonological processing during word recognition may be more effortful and may demand greater cognitive resources than orthographic processing. Furthermore, the additional phonological information represented in vowels appears to contribute little to word recognition in this population.

After introducing the QRTEngine, we briefly discuss how to create and distribute a Stroop task. Next, we describe a study in which we investigated the timing accuracy of the engine under different processor loads using external chronometry. Finally, we show that the QRTEngine can be used to reproduce classic behavioral effects in three reaction time paradigms: a Stroop task, an attentional blink task, and a masked-priming task. These findings demonstrate that QRTEngine can be used as a tool for conducting online behavioral research even when this requires accurate stimulus presentation times.},

If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others.

There is a gap in design education development regarding how to mediate ecological concerns with techno-scientific imperatives. Environmental education researchers can influence this new field by challenging existing approaches to design education with particular attention to the ways design either contributes to or hinders the development of a sustainable society. In order to enter this discussion with environmental education researchers we identify three ecological issues faced by designers and design educators, here we pay particular attention to Industrial Design. The question for this paper is, can environmental education researchers offer advice to the design education area that may help us develop ecologically sustainable design-based programs. The newness of ecological concerns in the design research and design education areas means that we have a great deal to learn. If environmental education researchers are able to assist us with our reflections on designing curricula that in turn encourages a more ecologically aware design profession then this would be a worthwhile contribution to design practice in Australia, and indeed the world.},

  abstract = {Research on the development of word recognition, like that on fluent word recognition, has been strongly influenced by the dual-route model. One route is non-lexical and indirect because access to lexical meaning is mediated by pre-lexical phonological representations assembled through the application of grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence (GPC) rules. The other route, which is independent of the first, is regarded as lexical and direct because orthographic representations of whole words are used to retrieve lexical meanings or post-lexical phonological representations. Evidence is reviewed for two opposing developmental hypotheses based on the dual-route model: fluent readers use both direct and indirect access to lexical meaning, while beginning readers use (1) only indirect access or (2) only direct access. It was concluded that neither mode of access predominates in early reading. A review of other evidence suggests two reasons why the dual-route model fails to provide a satisfactory account of the development of early word recognition. First, it does not offer an adequate characterization of the orthographic units represented in early lexicons. Second, the independence of the two routes prevents lexical information from being acquired through the application of GPC rules. Finally, alternatives to the dual-route model are discussed. One of the most promising is a single process lexical model in which it is proposed that acquisition and performance in word recognition can be accounted for by interactions among orthographic and phonological units of various sizes in the lexicon. Résumé La recherche sur le développement de la reconnaissance des mots, comme celle sur la reconnaissance des mots par le lecteur avancé, a été fortement influencée par le modèle des deux voies. Une voie est non-lexicale et indirecte parce que l'accès à la signification lexicale passe par des représentations phonologiques pré-lexicales qui sont assemblées par application de règles de correspondance entre graphèmes et phonèmes (CGP). L'autre voie, qui est indépendante de la première, est lexicale et directe, parce que des représentations orthographiques des mots complets sont utilisées por accéder à la signification lexicale ou aux représentations phonologiques post-lexicales. Nous passons en revue les données concernant deux hypothèses au sujet du développement fondées toutes deux sur le modèle des deux voies: les lecteurs avancées utilisent à la fois l'accès direct et l'accès indirect à la signification lexicale, alors que les lecteurs débutants utilisent soit 1) exclusivement l'accès indirect, soit 2) exclusivement l'accès direct. La conclusion est que aucun des deux modes d'accès ne prédomine chez les débutants. D'autres données suggèrent deux raisons pour lesquelles le modèle à deux voies ne fournit pas une explication satisfaisante du développement de la reconnaissance des mots. En premier lieu, il n'offre pas une caractérisation adéquate des unités orthographiques représentées dans le lexique des débutants. En deuxième lieu, l'indépendence des deux voies interdit que l'information lexicale soit acquise par application de règles CGP. Enfin, nous discutons des alternatives au modèle à deux voies. La plus prometteuse semble être un modèle lexical à processus unique dans lequel l'acquisition et la performance dans la reconnaissance des mots peut être expliquée par des interactions entre unités orthographiques et phonologiques de différentes tailles dans le lexique.},

  abstract = {The sources of forgetting in working memory (WM) are a matter of intense debate: Is there a time-related decay of memory traces, or is forgetting uniquely due to representation-based interference? In a previous study, we claimed to have provided evidence supporting the temporal decay hypothesis (S. Portrat, P. Barrouillet, \& V. Camos, 2008). However, reanalyzing our data, S. Lewandowsky and K. Oberauer (2009) demonstrated that they do not provide compelling evidence for temporal decay and suggested a class of alternative models favoring a representation-based interference account. In this article, we develop from the most recent proposals made by Lewandowsky and Oberauer 2 of the most plausible extensions of these alternative models. We show that neither of these extensions can account for recent findings related to between-domain WM performance and that both lead to predictions that are contradicted by new empirical evidence. Finally, we show that recent studies that have been claimed to rule out the temporal decay hypothesis do not resist close scrutiny. We conclude that the time-based resource-sharing model remains the most parsimonious way to account for forgetting and restoration of memory traces in WM.

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

Such results are explained by positing that specific content is retained in the mental representations of the learned (base) and novel (target) problems and therefore interferes with people's ability to recognize that the problems share the same underlying structure. A line of research is described that shows that differences in cover stories can affect transfer in a different way—by leading people to abstract different interpreted structures for formally isomorphic base and target problems. Results are described from several studies that show the impact of semantic dependencies between objects and relations on abstraction and transfer.

It is noted that agrammatic aphasics do not exhibit a normal pattern of verb production; their spontaneous speech is said to lack verbs, and the verbs that are produced lack inflection. Dutch is a so-called verb-second language in which the finite verb in the matrix clause is in the second position and nonfinite verbs are in the final position. Problems with verbs in Dutch agrammatic spontaneous speech are thought to be restricted to finite lexical verbs. The experiment evaluated whether these problems are caused by a morphological deficit or a syntactic deficit. 20 Ss (aged 27-78) participated. Results show that a syntactic deficit is more likely; Ss produced finite verbs in the base-generated position significantly better than finite verbs that have been moved to the second position. The authors conclude that in Dutch, a verb-second language, agrammatic aphasics demonstrate specific problems with moved finite verbs. This syntactic problem affects not only the proportion of finite verbs but also the diversity of the verbs and, hence, communicative contents.

BootLex, a new model which uses distributional cues to build a lexicon, demonstrates how much can be accomplished using this single source of information. This conceptually simple probabilistic algorithm achieves significant segmentation results on various kinds of language corpora – English, Japanese, and Spanish; child- and adult-directed speech, and written texts; and several variations in coding structure – and reveals which statistical characteristics of the input have an influence on segmentation performance. BootLex is then compared, quantitatively and qualitatively, with three other groups of computational models of the same infant segmentation process, paying particular attention to functional characteristics of the models and their similarity to human cognition. Commonalities and contrasts among the models are discussed, as well as their implications both for theories of the cognitive problem of segmentation itself, and for the general enterprise of computational cognitive modeling.},

Recently, Barr, Levy, Scheepers, and Tily, 2013 recommended fitting `maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification.},

The more those unconscious habits are explicated and the more we under stand how the disparate characteristics of the various intellectual cultures are related to the necessarily different interests, values, and epistemologies, the more feasible becomes the goal of transcending thought habits. Two sorts of interdisciplinary effort seem to have been successful: specific, delimited problems have been solved by teams in what is actually multidisciplinary rather than interdisciplinary work, and new disciplines have sprung up at the intersections of existing ones. STS fits neither of those patterns. Can it nevertheless be viable?},

All groups demonstrated effects of orthography at both ISIs (facilitory at 100 ms ISI and inhibitory at 750 ms ISI), supporting the authors' previous findings that effects of orthography emerge independent of site of brain damage and suggesting that orthographic effects in auditory word recognition tend to be largely strategic.

  abstract = {Booij argued recently that the problem of Agentive-Instrumental polysemy among Dutch nominalizations ending in -er can be resolved without resorting to the separation of derivation from affixation (the Separation Hypothesis). He argues for a ‘semantic extension scheme’ whereby an instrumental nominalization like open-er ‘opener’ is explained as a relatively less ‘agent-like’ semantic extension of the category ‘Agentive’: spel-er ‘player’. This question is only part of the much larger issue of derivational polysemy: why do certain categories, e.g. Agent and Instrumental, tend to receive polysemous marking across languages when others, e.g. Agentive and Action (nominalization), do not. This paper offers an alternate explanation of Booij's problem in a framework which addresses the larger issue. It proposes that the same universal categories, the category functions of traditional grammars, determine both inflectional and derivational relations (Unitary Grammatical Function Hypothesis). Combined with the Separation Hypothesis, unitary grammatical functions can predict (1) which languages are more likely to exhibit polysemy and which, synonymy, and (2) which categories are more or less likely to be shared by a polysemous derivational affix. Even enriched with semantic extension schemes, purely sign-based frameworks make the wrong predictions.},

Interlexical homographs are words that have two distinct meanings for one graphemic form common to two languages (e.g., COIN means “corner” in French). English-French bilinguals were biased to read such interlexical homographs in one specific language mode reading. The results of the first experiment suggest that language mode context does not initially block access to the alternative reading of these homographs. The second experiment confirms that the meaning accessed is not affected by language mode context but depends more on the frequency of occurrence of the reading in each language. The results indicate that it is frequency rather than language that determines the order in which lexical entries are accessed. These results suggest that lexical access in bilinguals is not initially language-selective.}

  abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that cognitive functions related to working memory (assessed with delay tasks) are distinct from those related to decision making (assessed with a gambling task), and that working memory and decision making depend in part on separate anatomical substrates. Normal controls (n = 21), subjects with lesions in the ventromedial (VM) (n = 9) or dorsolateral/high mesial (DL/M) prefrontal cortices (n = 10), performed on (1) modified delay tasks that assess working memory and (2) a gambling task designed to measure decision making. VM subjects with more anterior lesions (n = 4) performed defectively on the gambling but not the delay task. VM subjects with more posterior lesions (n = 5) were impaired on both tasks.Right DL/M subjects were impaired on the delay task but not the gambling task. Left DL/M subjects were not impaired on either task. The findings reveal a cognitive and anatomic double dissociation between deficits in decision making (anterior VM) and working memory (right DL/M). This presents the first direct evidence of such effects in humans using the lesion method and underscores the special importance of the VM prefrontal region in decision making, independent of a direct role in working memory.},

Currently, there is no neuropsychological probe to detect in the laboratory, and the cognitive and neural mechanisms responsible for this defect have resisted explanation. Here, using a novel task which simulates real-life decision-making in the way it factors uncertainty of premises and outcomes, as well as reward and punishment, we find that prefrontal patients, unlike controls, are oblivious to the future consequences of their actions, and seem to be guided by immediate prospects only. This finding offers, for the first time, the possibility of detecting these patients' elusive impairment in the laboratory, measuring it, and investigating its possible causes.},

  abstract = {The expressive power of language lies in its ability to construct an infinite array of ideas out of a finite set of pieces. Surprisingly, few neurolinguistic investigations probe the basic processes that constitute the foundation of this ability, choosing instead to focus on relatively complex combinatorial operations. Contrastingly, in the present work, we investigate the neural circuits underlying simple linguistic composition, such as required by the minimal phrase “red boat.” Using magnetoencephalography, we examined activity in humans generated at the visual presentation of target nouns, such as “boat,” and varied the combinatorial operations induced by its surrounding context. Nouns in minimal compositional contexts (“red boat”) were compared with those appearing in matched non-compositional contexts, such as after an unpronounceable consonant string (“xkq boat”) or within a list (“cup, boat”). Source analysis did not implicate traditional language areas (inferior frontal gyrus, posterior temporal regions) in such basic composition. Instead, we found increased combinatorial-related activity in the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). These regions have been linked previously to syntactic (LATL) and semantic (vmPFC) combinatorial processing in more complex linguistic contexts. Thus, we suggest that these regions play a role in basic syntactic and semantic composition, respectively. Importantly, the temporal ordering of the effects, in which LATL activity (∼225 ms) precedes vmPFC activity (∼400 ms), is consistent with many processing models that posit syntactic composition before semantic composition during the construction of linguistic representations.},

We describe the first longitudinal fMRI study to chart individual changes in cortical sensitivity to written words as reading develops. We conducted four annual measurements of brain function and reading skills in a heterogeneous group of children, initially 7–12 years old. The results show age-related increase in children's cortical sensitivity to word visibility in posterior left occipito-temporal sulcus (LOTS), nearby the anatomical location of the visual word form area. Moreover, the rate of increase in LOTS word sensitivity specifically correlates with the rate of improvement in sight word efficiency, a measure of speeded overt word reading. Other cortical regions, including V1, posterior parietal cortex, and the right homologue of LOTS, did not demonstrate such developmental changes. These results provide developmental support for the hypothesis that LOTS is part of the cortical circuitry that extracts visual word forms quickly and efficiently and highlight the importance of developing cortical sensitivity to word visibility in reading acquisition.},

Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in com- plicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state- of-the-art in certain areas. This monograph discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.}

In particular, our findings with respect to acquisition of the English binding pattern by native speakers of Serbo-Croatian follow from the theoretical framework we adopt. Current versions of the Binding Theory, including the Relativized SUBJECT analysis, cite morphological complexity as a defining characteristic of reflexives among languages. We argue that Serbo-Croatian speakers (mis)analyze morphologically complex English reflexives as simple, due to transfer from the first language (L1). Participants included 39 adolescent (aged 13-15 yrs) and 34 adult (aged 18-49 yrs) native speakers of Serbo-Croatian and 25 adolescent (aged 13-14 yrs) and 22 adult (aged 18-39 yrs) controls who were native speakers of English. Results indicate that transfer of L1 knowledge of the morphological structure of reflexives may crucially influence the pattern of reflexive interpretation in second language acquisition. This suggests that learners still have access to the principles of Universal Grammar, given that they are able to compute the binding domain as expected, although this domain differs from both the domain in their L1, and the domain in the target language.

  abstract = {The effect of morphological repetition at lag 0 and at lag 15 on lexical decision was investigated in Hebrew with three types of relation between prime and target. In the semantic-plus-morphological condition (SM), the prime and the target in each pair were two semantically related derivatives of the same root. In the “pure morphological” condition (M), the prime and the target derived from the same root, but their semantic association was very low, or nonexistent. In the semantic priming condition (S), primes and targets were semantically associated but were not morphologically related. The pure semantic relationship produced a significant facilitation at lag 0 that disappeared completely at lag 15. The pure morphological relation produced (smaller but) significant facilitation at lag 0 that was not attenuated at lag 15. When prime and target were semantically as well as morphologically related, the facilitation at lag 0 was similar to semantic priming, whereas at lag 15 it was similar to the pure morphological effect. Significant repetition effects at both lags were also found with non-words that shared the same (nonsensical) root and differed with respect to real derivational affixes. The differential time course for facilitation due to semantic and morphological relatedness suggests distinct underlying processes, although at lag 0 it is possible that semantic relatedness may augment the morphological repetition effect. Morphological repetition probably facilitates the retrieval of lexical information that, under certain circumstances, is necessary for lexical decision.},

Repetition facilitated performance in all tasks and for all stimulus types. However, ERPs were strongly affected by repetition only in lexical decision, face recognition, and letter search, when relatively long stimulus analysis and decision making processes were required. The ERP repetition effect consisted of a significant increase in P300 amplitude and a shortening of its latency. Repetition also resulted in the attenuation of a negative component that was tentatively identified as N400. These results suggest that immediate repetition facilitates stimulus identification and eliminates the need for stimulus analysis processes including access to semantic memory while making categorical decisions. While both factors affected RT, ERPs were modulated primarily by the elimination of the need to access to semantic memory and by the consequent speeding of categorical decision processes.

Subjects performed a visual target detection task in which they mentally counted the number of occurrences of pictorial stimuli from a designated category such as butterflies. In separate experiments, target stimuli were embedded within a series of other stimuli including unfamiliar human faces and isolated face components, inverted faces, distorted faces, animal faces, and other nonface stimuli. Human faces evoked a negative potential at 172 msec (N170), which was absent from the ERPs elicited by other animate and inanimate nonface stimuli. N170 was largest over the posterior temporal scalp and was larger over the right than the left hemisphere. N170 was delayed when faces were presented upside-down, but its amplitude did not change. When presented in isolation, eyes elicited an N170 that was significantly larger than that elicited by whole faces, while noses and lips elicited small negative ERPs about 50 msec later than N170. Distorted human faces, in which the locations of inner face components were altered, elicited an N170 similar in amplitude to that elicited by normal faces. However, faces of animals, human hands, cars, and items of furniture did not evoke N170. N170 may reflect the operation of a neural mechanism tuned to detect (as opposed to identify) human faces, similar to the “structural encoder” suggested by Bruce and Young (1986). A similar function has been proposed for the face-selective N200 ERP recorded from the middle fusiform and posterior inferior temporal gyri using subdural electrodes in humans (Allison, McCarthy, Nobre, Puce, \& Belger, 1994c). However, the differential sensitivity of N170 to eyes in isolation suggests that N170 may reflect the activation of an eye-sensitive region of cortex. The voltage distribution of N170 over the scalp is consistent with a neural generator located in the occipitotemporal sulcus lateral to the fusiform/inferior temporal region that generates N200.},

Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by visually presented lists of words were recorded while subjects were involved in a series of oddball tasks. The distinction between the designated target and nontarget stimuli was manipulated to induce a different level of processing in each session (visual, phonological/phonetic, phonological/lexical, and semantic). The ERPs of main interest in this study were those elicited by nontarget stimuli. In the visual task the targets were twice as big as the nontargets. Words, pseudowords, strings of consonants, strings of alphanumeric symbols, and strings of forms elicited a sharp negative peak at 170 msec (N170); their distribution was limited to the occipito-temporal sites. For the left hemisphere electrode sites, the N170 was larger for orthographic than for nonorthographic stimuli and vice versa for the right hemisphere. The ERPs elicited by all orthographic stimuli formed a clearly distinct cluster that was different from the ERPs elicited by nonorthographic stimuli. In the phonological/phonetic decision task the targets were words and pseudowords rhyming with the French word vitrail, whereas the nontargets were words, pseudowords, and strings of consonants that did not rhyme with vitrail. The most conspicuous potential was a negative peak at 320 msec, which was similarly elicited by pronounceable stimuli but not by nonpronounceable stimuli. The N320 was bilaterally distributed over the middle temporal lobe and was significantly larger over the left than over the right hemisphere. In the phonological/lexical processing task we compared the ERPs elicited by strings of consonants (among which words were selected), pseudowords (among which words were selected), and by words (among which pseudowords were selected). The most conspicu- us potential in these tasks was a negative potential peaking at 350 msec (N350) elicited by phonologically legal but not by phonologically illegal stimuli. The distribution of the N350 was similar to that of the N320, but it was broader and including temporo-parietal areas that were not activated in the “rhyme” task. Finally, in the semantic task the targets were abstract words, and the nontargets were concrete words, pseudowords, and strings of consonants. The negative potential in this task peaked at 450 msec. Unlike the lexical decision, the negative peak in this task significantly distinguished not only between phonologically legal and illegal words but also between meaningful (words) and meaningless (pseudowords) phonologically legal structures. The distribution of the N450 included the areas activated in the lexical decision task but also areas in the fronto-central regions. The present data corroborated the functional neuro-anatomy of word recognition systems suggested by other neuroimaging methods and described their timecourse, supporting a cascade-type process that involves different but interconnected neural modules, each responsible for a different level of processing word-related information.},

  abstract = {ERPs were recorded during a lexical decision task in order to investigate electrophysiological concomitants of semantic priming. The stimuli were 240 words and 240 nonwords presented one per trial at a fixed intertrial interval. Subjects were required to classify each stimulus as a word or nonword by pressing one of two response buttons. ERPs were recorded from 14 scalp locations, the right suborbital ridge, and the left earlobe, all referred to a balanced non-cephalic reference. RT and error data confirmed that semantic priming occurred under the conditions employed: primed words (those preceded by a semantically related word) were identified as words faster and more accurately than were unprimed words (those preceded by semantically unrelated words or nonwords). ERPs for all stimulus types were characterized by a large positivity peaking between 550 and 650 msec, preceded by a negative-going deflection peaking at approximately 400 msec. ERPs for primed and unprimed words were shown to differ significantly, diverging 200–250 msec following stimulus onset, reaching a maximum near the peak of the negative-going deflection at 400 msec. These differences were observed at locations over both hemispheres and were maximal in the centroparietal region. Although P300 latency differences between primed and unprimed words were also obtained, the priming effect on ERPs at shorter latencies could not be explained solely by P300 latency effects. Possible relationships between these ERP concomitants of semantic priming and P300, N200, and N400 were discussed.},

The concept of the etymon as the cornerstone of Semitic morphology is in sharp contrast to the well-accepted view that considers the 3-consonantal root to be the kernel and major carrier of meaning in Hebrew and Arabic words. Boudelaa and Marslen-Wilson were not concerned with the linguistic status of the etymon theory, but focused on the psychological reality of the etymon. Boudelaa and Marslen-Wilson also report a set of experiments exploring cross-modality and masked priming effects between words sharing the etymon, with or without a semantic relation between primes and targets. In addition to the theoretical and empirical complications that emerge assuming that etymons are primary morphemic units in Arabic, the present authors are also puzzled by some aspects of the data reported by Boudelaa and Marslen-Wilson.

In print, dots that represent vowels in Hebrew script are almost always omitted, and because a single consonant string may represent several different words (with different vowels), the reader can assign to it a unique meaning and pronunciation only in relation to the syntactic and semantic contexts. Two experiments involving a total of 32 undergraduates manipulated phonemic ambiguity by comparing consonant strings that have only a single meaningful pronunciation with strings that are several meaningful pronunciations. Although naming was slower when several pronunciations were possible, these phonemically ambiguous strings were not recognized more slowly in a lexical-decision task. A 3rd study, in which lexical decisions were made by 16 undergraduates for consonant strings presented with the vowel dots, showed that nonword homographs were rejected more slowly than were nonword homophones. These results suggest that in Hebrew, orthographic codes play a more important role in the process of word recognition than do phonemic codes, especially in comparison with the roles played in other languages.

In the present experiment, we recorded event-related brain potentials in order to explore possible contextual influences on the activity of this perceptual mechanism. Subjects were first exposed to pairs of small shapes, which did not elicit any face-specific brain activity. The same stimuli, however, elicited face-specific brain activity after subjects saw them embedded in schematic faces, which probably primed the subjects to interpret the shapes as schematic eyes. No face-specific activity was observed when objects rather than faces were used to form the context. We conclude that the activity of face-specific extrastriate perceptual mechanisms can be modulated by contextual constraints that determine the significance of the visual input.},

  abstract = {The metallic impregnation invented by Camillo Golgi in 1873 has allowed the visualization of individual neurons in their entirety, leading to a breakthrough in the knowledge on the structure of the nervous system. Professor of Histology and of General Pathology, Golgi worked for decades at the University of Pavia, leading a very active laboratory. Unfortunately, most of Golgi's histological preparations are lost. The present contribution provides an account of the original slides on the nervous system from Golgi's laboratory available nowadays at the Golgi Museum and Historical Museum of the University of Pavia. Knowledge on the organization of the nervous tissue at the time of Golgi's observations is recalled. Notes on the equipment of Golgi's laboratory and the methodology Golgi used for his preparations are presented. Images of neurons from his slides (mostly from hippocampus, neocortex and cerebellum) are here shown for the first time together with some of Golgi's drawings. The sections are stained with the Golgi impregnation and Cajal stain. Golgi-impregnated sections are very thick (some more than 150 μm) and require continuous focusing during the microscopic observation. Heterogeneity of neuronal size and shape, free endings of distal dendritic arborizations, axonal branching stand out at the microscopic observation of Golgi-impregnated sections and in Golgi's drawings, and were novel findings at his time. Golgi also pointed out that the axon only originates from cell bodies, representing a constant and distinctive feature of nerve cells which distinguishes them from glia, and subserving transmission at a distance. Dendritic spines can be seen in some cortical neurons, although Golgi, possibly worried about artifacts, did not identify them. The puzzling intricacy of fully impregnated nervous tissue components offered to the first microscopic observations still elicit nowadays the emotion Golgi must have felt looking at his slides.},

In contrast, the inflection of irregular sounding nouns is strongly sensitive to their similarity to stored irregular tokens.

Exp 3 (39 Ss) demonstrates that Hebrew speakers assign the default regular inflection to borrowings and names that are identical to existing irregular nouns. The existence of default inflection in Hebrew is incompatible with the distributional asymmetry hypothesis. Our findings also lend no support for a type-frequency account.

Subjects (Ss) in Exps 1 and 2 were 20 native Hebrew speakers. Ss in Exp 3 were 24 native Hebrews speakers. Results show that these hallmarks of regularity may be found whether or not the plural form preserves the stem faithfully: People apply the regular suffix to novel nouns that do not resemble existing nouns and to names that sound like irregular nouns, regardless of whether the stem is ordinarily preserved in the plural of that family of nouns. When they pluralize names, they do not apply the stem changes that are found in their homophonous nouns, replicating an effect found in English and German. These findings show that the distinction between regular and irregular phenomena cannot be reduced to differences in the kinds of phonological changes associated with those phenomena in English. Instead, regularity and irregularity must be distinguished in terms of the kinds of mental computations that effect them: symbolic operations versus memorized idiosyncrasies.

This asymmetry is explained by a universal constraint on phonological representations, the Obligatory Contour Principle. Three experiments with 60 Ss examined whether this phonological constraint affects performance in a lexical decision task. The rejection of nonwords generated from novel roots with root-initial gemination was significantly faster than roots with final gemination controls. The emergence of this asymmetry regardless of the position of geminates in the word implicates a constraint on root, rather than simply word structure. Results further indicate that speakers are sensitive to the structure of geminate bigrams. Nonwords formed from roots with final gemination were significantly more difficult to reject than foils generated from frequency-matched no gemination controls. Speakers are thus sensitive to the identity of geminates and constrain their location in the root. These findings suggest that the representations assembled in reading a deep orthography are structured linguistic entities, constrained by phonological competence.

If linguistic constraints appeal to variables, rather than instances, then they should generalize to any representable novel instance, including instances that fall beyond the phonological space of a language. This prediction was tested by investigating a constraint on the structure of Hebrew roots. Hebrew frequently exhibits geminates in its roots, but it strictly constraints their location: geminates are frequent at the end of the root, but rare at its beginning. Symbolic accounts capture the ban on root-initial geminates as XXY, where X and Y are variables that stand for any two distinct consonants. If the constraint on root structure appeals to the identity of abstract variables, then speakers should be able to extend it to root geminates with foreign phonemes, including phonemes with foreign feature values. Findings are presented from three experiments supporting this prediction. These results suggest that a complete account of linguistic processing must incorporate mechanisms for generalization outside the representational space of trained items. Mentally-represented variables would allow speakers to make such generalizations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

At bottom, Seidenberg \& Arnoldussen fail to recognize the consequences of our choice of German words, rather than English, as stimuli. Once the concept of “difficulty” is given substance in this context, it appears that in German, the brain activates more extensively when dealing with what in the connectionist universe should be, if anything, the easier stimuli, not the harder ones as suggested by Seidenberg \& Arnoldussen. Thus regularity cannot be reduced to difficulty.},

  abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REALITY OF PHONAESTHEMES BENJAMIN K. BERGEN University of Hawai’i at Manoa The psychological reality of English phonaesthemes is demonstrated through a priming experiment with native speakers of American English. Phonaesthemes are well-represented soundmeaning pairings, such as English gl-, which occurs in numerous words with meanings relating to light and vision. In the experiment, phonaesthemes, despite being noncompositional in nature, displayed priming effects much like those that have been reported for compositional morphemes. These effects could not be explained as the result of semantic or phonological priming, either alone or in combination. The results support a view of the lexicon in which shared form and meaning across words is a key factor in their relatedness, and in which morphological composition is not required for internal word structure to play a role in language processing.* 1. INTRODUCTION. Phonaesthemes (Firth 1930) are frequently recurring soundmeaning pairings that are not clearly contrastive morphemes. An example is the English onsetgl- (Wallis 1699, Bloomfield 1933), which, like otherphonaesthemes, is relatively infrequent in English, except among words with meanings related to ‘vision’ and ‘light’. Some of these are exemplified in 1a. Another well-documented phonaestheme (Wallis 1699, Bloomfield 1933) is the English onset sn-, which occurs in a large number of words relating to ‘mouth’ and ‘nose’ (1b). (1) a. gl- ‘light, vision’ glimmer, glisten, glitter, gleam, glow, glint, etc. b. sn- ‘nose, mouth’ snore, snack, snout, snarl, snort, sniff, sneeze, etc. When viewed simply as statistically aberrant distributions of sound-meaning pairings in the lexicon, phonaesthemes are found to be pervasive in human languages. They have been documented in such diverse languages as English (Wallis 1699, Firth 1930, Marchand 1959, Bolinger 1949, 1980), Indonesian (McCune 1983) and other Austronesian languages (Blust 1988), Japanese (Hamano 1998), Ojibwa (Rhodes 1981), and Swedish (Abelin 1999). While it is difficult to establish reliable estimates of how many of the world’s languages contain phonaesthemes, or how many words in a given language’s lexicon have phonaesthemes in them, every systematic study of a particular language has produced results suggesting that that language has phonaesthemes. In general, phonaesthemes seem to appear in content words over function words, and in more specific (or subordinate level) rather than more general (or basic level) words. In addition to distributional evidence, phonaesthemes can be detected through their role in language change, in particular by the part they play in the generation of neologisms (Joseph 1987). Phonaesthemes have been implicated in both the production and perception of neologisms on the basis of experimental (Abelin 1999) and comparative studies (Blust 1988, 2003). The recurrent finding of note in this latter area is that in a given set of related languages, phonaesthemes that appear in some languages will also appearin otherlanguages but in words that are not cognates. Forexample, the Austronesian phonaestheme √ occurs in initial position in words that have meanings related to ‘nose’ or ‘mouth’ (Blust 2003). In particular, it appears in words meaning ‘chew, masticate, ruminate’, such as Amis √af√af, Toba Batak √altok, and Trukese √u´, among others, but none of these words are cognates. * Thanks to Nancy Chang, Jerome Feldman, Larry Hyman, Sharon Inkelas, George Lakoff, and Madelaine Plauche´ for helpful comments on drafts of related work, and to Amy Schafer and Robert Blust, in addition to two anonymous referees, for very useful suggestions on this paper. 290 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REALITY OF PHONAESTHEMES 291 While statistically significant representation in the lexicon and participation in the construction of neologisms are important convergent indications that phonaesthemes are a viable part of language, these two types of evidence leave room for different interpretations of what exactly the status is of phonaesthemes. The extent to which phonaesthemes play a role in the synchronic mental organization of language remains an open question. Indeed, their cognitive status remains controversial in part because they do not fit well into linguistic theories that view compositionality as a defining characteristic of morphological complexity, such as so-called ITEM-AND-ARRANGEMENT models (Hockett 1954). On these compositional types of account, phonaesthemes belong outside the scope of regular morphological analysis. By contrast, noncompositional theories of morphology predict that recurrent sound-meaning pairings in a language, whether compositional or not, will rise...},

Converging information from subject-verb agreement and animacy cues increased use of these non-canonical word orders; however, weaker agreement and animacy cues also appeared to slow down reaction times. Non-canonical VOS, followed by OSV strategies, stabilized between 7 and 12 yrs of age, when adult-like patterns of competition and convergence emerged in the interaction between strong and weak cues.

Type frequency is taken to reflect the lexicon, token frequency language use. Type and token frequencies were compared for a total of 10 basic distinctions at the phonological, morphological, lexical and lexico-syntactic levels in English. These include consonants vs. vowels, prefixes vs. suffixes, count vs. mass nouns and transitive vs. intransitive verbs. The empirical analysis reveals that type frequencies may be more, or less, extreme than token frequencies. Non-phonological distinctions evince a higher discrepancy between type and token frequency than phonological ones. In addition, complexity is more strongly discouraged in token than in type frequency, suggesting that it is more of an issue in processing than in storage. It is concluded that the lexicon constrains language use, though only to a limited extent.},

However, it is not as arbitrary as one might conclude. Investigating the spelling of four derivational suffixes, we show that the spelling of English suffixes is quite consistent. Homophonous endings of morphologically simple words are spelled differently, keeping the suffix spelling distinct (cf. e.g. \&lt;nervous vs. \&lt;service/*\&lt;servous). English spelling thus provides morphological cues for the reader. Diachronically, we show that this system emerged without explicit regulation, but as a result of self-organization. We use the Helsinki corpus to show how variation was gradually reduced for each of the suffixes. The regular spellings of today emerged gradually, through a sorting-out process of competition between alternate spellings.* {$<$}/p{$>$}},

In the first experiment, words were either unicolor or had their adjacent syllables segmented with two different colors (color/syllable congruent condition). Reaction times for correct word identification were measured for the two different conditions and for two different print sizes. Results show a significant decrease in reaction time for the color/syllable congruent condition compared with the unicolor condition. A second experiment suggests that this effect is specific to syllable decomposition and results from strategic, presumably involving attentional factors, rather than stimulus-driven control.},

College students participated in 6 experiments that show that family size plays a role for both inflected and derived words.

A recent visual lexical decision study indicated that the same inflected words with -jA were sensitive to surface frequency manipulations, but not to base frequency manipulations. The authors interpreted these results to suggest that these inflectional forms are stored and processed by means of their whole-word representations. In contrast, the present context study shows both a surface frequency effect and a lagged base frequency effect. The authors argue that syntactic cues prior to the target word prime the inflectional reading of the -jA suffix, and as a consequence the base is reinstated as an effective unit in processing these nouns with a homonymic suffix.

  abstract = {Prior evidence from masked morphological priming has revealed conflicting findings regarding the acquisition of morpho-orthographic segmentation mechanisms in developing readers. Here, we examined changes in masked morphological priming across grade within a large sample of French primary school children (n=191, Grades 2–5) and how these effects are modulated by individual differences in reading proficiency, spelling proficiency, and morphological awareness. Target words were preceded by either (a) a suffixed word prime (e.g., tristesse–TRISTE), (b) a suffixed nonword prime (e.g., tristerie–TRISTE), (c) a non-suffixed nonword prime (e.g., tristald–TRISTE), or (d) an unrelated prime (e.g., direction–TRISTE) using very short prime durations (50ms). Moreover, a frequency manipulation was included for suffixes and non-suffixes. The results revealed robust suffixed word priming across all children independent of grade and proficiency. On the other hand, priming in the suffixed and non-suffixed nonword conditions was modulated by reading proficiency, with high-proficiency children showing facilitation and low-proficiency children showing inhibition. The effects of suffix and non-suffix frequency were modulated by grade, with decreasing effects as grade increased. None of the observed priming effects were modulated by grade, spelling proficiency, or morphological awareness. The results suggest that reading proficiency is an important predictor for embedded stem activation mechanisms in primary school children, which we discuss in the context of recent theories of morphological processing.},

  abstract = {One key finding in support of the hypothesis that written words are automatically parsed into component morphemes independently of the true morphological structure of the stimuli, so-called morpho-orthographic segmentation, is that suffixed nonword primes facilitate the visual recognition of a stem target (rapidifier-RAPIDE) whereas non-suffixed primes (rapiduit-RAPIDE) do not. However, Morris, Porter, Grainger, and Holcomb (Language \& Cognitive Processes, 26(4–6), 558–599, 2011)reported equivalent priming from suffixed and non-suffixed nonword primes, hence questioning the morphological nature of prior findings. Here we provide a further investigation of masked priming with morphologically complex nonword primes with an aim to isolate factors that modulate the size of these priming effects. We conducted a masked primed lexical decision experiment in French, in which the same target (TRISTE) was preceded by a suffixed word (tristesse), a suffixed nonword (tristerie), a non-suffixed nonword (tristald), or an unrelated prime word (direction). Participants were split into two groups, based on their language proficiency. The results show that in the high proficiency group, comparable magnitudes of priming were obtained in all three related prime conditions (including the non-suffixed condition) relative to unrelated primes, whereas in the low proficiency group, priming was significantly reduced in the non-suffixed condition compared to the two suffixed conditions. These findings provide further evidence that individual differences in language proficiency can modulate the impact of morphological factors during reading, and an explanation for the discrepant findings in prior research.},

Results revealed a stem-by-modality and a suffix-by-modality interaction, indicating that morphology plays a more prominent role in the visual than in the auditory domain.

Experiment 1 tested adult readers, showing that priming from both pseudo- and truly suffixed primes could be obtained using our own set of high-frequency word materials. Experiment 2 assessed a group of Year 3 and Year 5 children, but priming only occurred when prime and target shared a true morphological relationship, and not when the relationship was pseudomorphological.

Using a visual lexical decision task, we compared priming from truly suffixed primes (hunter-HUNT), completely opaque pseudo-suffixed primes (corner-CORN), and non-suffixed primes (cashew-CASH). The results show comparable magnitudes of priming for the truly suffixed and pseudo-suffixed primes, and no priming from non-suffixed primes, and therefore provide further important evidence in support of morpho-orthographic segmentation processes operating in the absence of any possible role for semantics.},

  abstract = {Models of morphological processing make different predictions about whether morphologically complex written words are initially decomposed and recognized on the basis of their morphemic subunits or whether they can directly be accessed as whole words and at what point semantics begin to influence morphological processing. In this study, we used unprimed and masked primed lexical decision to compare truly suffixed (darkest) and pseudosuffixed words (glossary) with within-boundary (drakest/golssary) to across-boundary (darekst/glosasry) letter transpositions. Significant transposed-letter similarity effects were found independently of the morphological position of the letter transposition, demonstrating that, in English, morphologically complex whole-word representations can be directly accessed at initial word processing stages. In a third masked primed lexical decision experiment, the same materials were used in the context of stem target priming, and it was found that truly suffixed primes facilitate the recognition of their stem-target (darkest–DARK) to the same extent as pseudosuffixed primes (glossary–GLOSS), which is consistent with theories of early morpho-orthographic decomposition. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for both whole-word access and morphological decomposition at initial stages of visual word recognition and are discussed in the context of a hybrid account.

The behavioral data showed significant effects of morphological and semantic priming, with the magnitude of morphological priming being significantly larger than the magnitude of semantic priming. The ERP data revealed significant morphological but no semantic priming at 100–250 ms. Furthermore, a reduction of the N400 amplitude in the morphological condition compared to the semantic and orthographic condition demonstrates that the morphological priming effect was not entirely due to the semantic or orthographic overlap between the prime and the target. The present data reflect an early process of semantically blind morphological decomposition, and a later process of morpho-semantic decomposition, which we discuss in the context of recent morphological processing theories.},

Here we examine the specific nature of such priming effects by testing whether they are modulated by morphological family size. We reasoned that if the effects are driven by pre-lexical orthographic processing then they should not be influenced by the family size of the embedded target word. On the contrary, we found that embedded words having several morphologically related family members (e.g., serpentoche–SERPENT [English: snakerel–SNAKE]—serpents, serpentin, serpentine, serpenter, serpentant) generated greater priming than embedded words having only the plural form in the morphological family (e.g., dauphingri–DAUPHIN [English: dolphinald–DOLPHIN]). We therefore conclude that embedded stem priming is at least partly driven by processing at the level of lexical and morpho-semantic representations.

This possibility is examined in three studies. In Study 1, bilinguals outperformed monolinguals on versions of the problem containing moderate representational demands but not on a more demanding condition. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that bilingual children were more skilled than monolinguals when the target dimensions were perceptual features of the stimulus and that the two groups were equivalent when the target dimensions were semantic features. The conclusions are that bilinguals have better inhibitory control for ignoring perceptual information than monolinguals do but are not more skilled in representation, confirming the results of the original study. The results also identify the ability to ignore an obsolete display feature as the critical difficulty in solving this task.},

  abstract = {It is hypothesized that creole languages are largely invented by children and show fundamental similarities, which derive from a biological program for language. The structures of Hawaiian Pidgin and Hawaiian Creole are contrasted, and evidence is provided to show that the latter derived from the former in a single generation. A realistic model of the processes of Creole formation shows how several specific historical and demographic factors interacted to restrict, in varying degrees, the access of pidgin speakers to the dominant language, and hence the nature of input to the children of those speakers. It is shown that the resulting similarities of Creole languages derive from a single grammar with a restricted list of categories and operations. However, grammars of individual Creoles will differ from this grammar to a varying extent: The degree of difference will correlate very closely with the quantity of dominant-language input, which in turn is controlled by extralinguistic factors. Alternative explanations of the above phenomena are surveyed, in particular, substratum theory and monogenesis: Both are found inadequate to account for the facts. Primary acquisition is examined in light of the general hypothesis, and it is suggested that the bioprogram provides a skeletal model of language which the child can then readily convert into the target language. Cases of systematic error and precocious learning provide indirect support for the hypothesis. Some conjectures are made concerning the evolutionary origins of the bioprogram and what study of Creoles and related topics might reveal about language origins.},

In this study, we compare the neural correlates of morphological processing in Hebrew—a Semitic language with a rich and systematic morphology, to those revealed in English—an Indo-European language with a linear morphology. Using fMRI, we show that while in the bilingual brain both languages involve a common neural circuitry in processing morphological structure, this activation is significantly modulated by the different aspects of language. Whereas in Hebrew, morphological processing is independent of semantics, in English, morphological activation is clearly modulated by semantic overlap. These findings suggest that the processes involved in reading words are not universal, and therefore impose important constraints on current models of visual word recognition.

Hebrew provides a unique opportunity to examine morphological processing in the brain because of its rich morphological system. In an fMRI masked priming experiment, we investigated the neural networks involved in implicit morphological processing in Hebrew. In the 1MFG and 1IFG, activation was found to be significantly reduced when the primes were morphologically related to the targets. This effect was not influenced by the semantic transparency of the morphological prime, and was not found in the semantic or orthographic condition. Additional morphologically related decrease in activation was found in the 1IPL, where activation was significantly modulated by semantic transparency. Our findings regarding implicit morphological processing suggest that morphology is an automatic and distinct aspect of visually processing words. These results also coincide with the behavioral data previously obtained demonstrating the central role of morphological processing in reading Hebrew.

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons, can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensional image. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position and image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory.

  abstract = {The technology to collect brain imaging and physiological measures has become portable and ubiquitous, opening the possibility of large-scale analysis of real-world human imaging. By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed. Users can download the PREP pipeline as a freely available MATLAB library from http://eegstudy.org/prepcode.},

The prime stimuli were high-frequency words either from the same language as that of the target or from the other language known by the bilingual subjects. When the prime and target were from the same language, orthographically related primes systematically inhibited target word recognition, whereas orthographically dissimilar primes did not. When the prime and target were words from different languages, the amount of inhibition increased as a function of subjects’ level of proficiency in the prime word’s language, with highly proficient bilinguals showing practically equivalent amounts of within and across language inhibitory priming. These results strongly suggest that a printed string of letters can simultaneously activate lexical representations in both of the bilingual’s languages (insofar as these share the same alphabet), even when subjects are performing a monolingual task.},

  abstract = {Componential theories of lexical semantics assume that concepts can be represented by sets of features or attributes that are in some sense primitive or basic components of meaning. The binary features used in classical category and prototype theories are problematic in that these features are themselves complex concepts, leaving open the question of what constitutes a primitive feature. The present availability of brain imaging tools has enhanced interest in how concepts are represented in brains, and accumulating evidence supports the claim that these representations are at least partly 'embodied' in the perception, action, and other modal neural systems through which concepts are experienced. In this study we explore the possibility of devising a componential model of semantic representation based entirely on such functional divisions in the human brain. We propose a basic set of approximately 65 experiential attributes based on neurobiological considerations, comprising sensory, motor, spatial, temporal, affective, social, and cognitive experiences. We provide normative data on the salience of each attribute for a large set of English nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and show how these attribute vectors distinguish a priori conceptual categories and capture semantic similarity. Robust quantitative differences between concrete object categories were observed across a large number of attribute dimensions. A within- versus between-category similarity metric showed much greater separation between categories than representations derived from distributional (latent semantic) analysis of text. Cluster analyses were used to explore the similarity structure in the data independent of a priori labels, revealing several novel category distinctions. We discuss how such a representation might deal with various longstanding problems in semantic theory, such as feature selection and weighting, representation of abstract concepts, effects of context on semantic retrieval, and conceptual combination. In contrast to componential models based on verbal features, the proposed representation systematically relates semantic content to large-scale brain networks and biologically plausible accounts of concept acquisition.

  abstract = {Functional organization of the lateral temporal cortex in humans is not well understood. We recorded blood oxygenation signals from the temporal lobes of normal volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging during stimulation with unstructured noise, frequency-modulated (FM) tones, reversed speech, pseudowords and words. For all conditions, subjects performed a material- nonspecific detection response when a train of stimuli began or ceased. Dorsal areas surrounding Heschl's gyrus bilaterally, particularly the planum temporale and dorsolateral superior temporal gyrus, were more strongly activated by FM tones than by noise, suggesting a role in processing simple temporally encoded auditory information. Distinct from these dorsolateral areas, regions centered in the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally were more activated by speech stimuli than by FM tones. Identical results were obtained in this region using words, pseudowords and reversed speech, suggesting that the speech–tones activation difference is due to acoustic rather than linguistic factors. In contrast, previous comparisons between word and nonword speech sounds showed left-lateralized activation differences in more ventral temporal and temporoparietal regions that are likely involved in processing lexical–semantic or syntactic information associated with words. The results indicate functional subdivision of the human lateral temporal cortex and provide a preliminary framework for understanding the cortical processing of speech sounds.},

Recent neuroimaging studies demonstrate two striking results: the participation of modality-specific sensory, motor, and emotion systems in language comprehension, and the existence of large brain regions that participate in comprehension tasks but are not modality-specific. These latter regions, which include the inferior parietal lobe and much of the temporal lobe, lie at convergences of multiple perceptual processing streams. These convergences enable increasingly abstract, supramodal representations of perceptual experience that support a variety of conceptual functions including object recognition, social cognition, language, and the remarkable human capacity to remember the past and imagine the future.},

We investigated the extent to which individuals with ASD might show a specific attenuation of implicit social biases, using Implicit Association Tests (IATs) involving social (gender, race) and nonsocial (nature, shoes) categories. High-functioning adults with ASD showed intact but reduced IAT effects relative to healthy control participants. We observed no selective attenuation of implicit social (vs. nonsocial) biases in our ASD population. To extend these results, we supplemented our healthy control data with data collected from a large online sample from the general population and explored correlations between autistic traits and IAT effects. We observed no systematic relationship between autistic traits and implicit social biases in our online and control samples. Taken together, these results suggest that implicit social biases, as measured by the IAT, are largely intact in ASD.},

The most common type of expected sensory events are those generated as a consequence of self-generated actions. Using H2 15O PET, we studied brain responses to such predictable sensory events (tones) and to similar unpredictable events and especially how the processing of predictable sensory events is modified by the context of a causative self-generated action. Increases in activity when the tones were unpredictable were seen in the inferior and superior temporal lobe bilaterally, the right parahippocampal gyrus and right parietal cortex. Self-generated actions produced activity in a number of motor and premotor areas, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We observed an interaction between the predictability of stimuli and self-generated actions in several areas, including the medial posterior cingulate cortex, left insula, dorsomedial thalamus, superior colliculus and right inferior temporal cortex. This modulation of activity associated with stimulus predictability in the context of self-generated actions implies that these areas may be involved in self-monitoring processes. Detection of expected stimuli and the detection of the sensory consequences of self-generated actions appear to be functionally distinct processes, and are carried out in different cortical areas. These observations support theoretical approaches to cognition that postulate the existence of a self-monitoring system.},

Metaphorical senses could simply be added to the lexicon, as idioms, or combined with literal senses by abstraction. These approaches do not, as Lakoff and Johnson (1980) pointed out, account for systematicity. One can not only "grasp lectures," but "manipulate beliefs," "toss theories around," and "juggle formulas." A third possible strategy is sense extension, where rules derive a figurative sense by considering the violated literal constraints. The experiment reported here investigated such familiar and systematic metaphors, comparing the time to recognize words used in systematic metaphors as opposed to literal and anomalous control sentences. The results suggest a stage model of processing, in which the second, failure-driven stage is obligatory: If processing using literal senses (including any senses that have been lexicalized by idiom addition or abstraction) fails, then automatically check for any applicable sense extension rules. Finally, a computational model of the various strategies for lexicalization is briefly described.},

However, few have questioned the universality of the duality of patterning. Following Hockett, most linguists assume that in all human languages, discrete meaningless parts combine to form meaningful units that, themselves, recombine. However, an alternative interpretation, explored in this article, is that duality, like other proposed linguistic universals, is a statistical tendency reflecting a complex set of factors, and most centrally, the need for some minimal number of basic units that can recombine to yield a potentially infinite set of form-meaning correspondences. If this is the essence of duality, then we expect: languages where duality is not a central component of grammar; languages where most, but not all, utterances are decomposable into meaningless phonological units; and different types of phonological building blocks in different languages. These expectations appear to be confirmed by natural language data.},

The analyses distinguish morphomic stems, which underlie morphosyntactically distinct word forms, from inflectional stems, which realize tense and mood features and provide the input to regular agreement rules. It is argued that the recognition of these stem types simplifies the description of West Germanic conjugations, supports a general realization-based approach, and suggests a reinterpretation of current realizational models.*}

However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

Nineteen subjects listened passively to or discriminated actively between sequences of bisyllabic Dutch words, which started with either a weak or a strong syllable. Weak-initial words, which constitute 12\% of the Dutch lexicon, evoked more negativity than strong-initial words in the interval between P2 and N400 components of the auditory event-related potential. This negativity was denoted as N325. The N325 was larger during stress discrimination than during passive listening. N325 was also larger when a weak-initial word followed a sequence of strong-initial words than when it followed words with the same stress pattern. The latter difference was larger for listeners who performed well on stress discrimination. It was concluded that the N325 is probably a manifestation of the extraction of metrical stress from the acoustic signal and its transformation into task requirements.},

Finally, the implications of changes in third person singular, sex-indefinite pronouns for several issues of general interest within linguistics are explored.},

We found that phonetic representations are hosted bilaterally in primary and secondary auditory cortices and that their neural quality (in terms of robustness and distinctness) is intact in adults with dyslexia. However, the functional and structural connectivity between the bilateral auditory cortices and the left inferior frontal gyrus (a region involved in higher-level phonological processing) is significantly hampered in dyslexies, suggesting deficient access to otherwise intact phonetic representations.}

Testing human adults (n = 35, 21 females), we document, in the context of a classical visual SL task, divergent rhythmic EEG activity in the interstimulus delay periods within patterns versus between patterns (i.e., pattern transitions). Our findings reveal increased oscillatory activity in the beta band (∼20 Hz) at triplet transitions that indexes learning: it emerges with increased pattern repetitions; and importantly, it is highly correlated with behavioral learning outcomes. These findings hold the promise of converging on an online measure of learning regularities and provide important theoretical insights regarding the mechanisms of SL and prediction., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Statistical learning has become a major theoretical construct in cognitive science, providing the primary means by which organisms learn about regularities in the environment. As such, it is a critical building block for basic and higher-order cognitive functions. Here we identify, for the first time, a spectral neural index in the time window before stimulus presentation, which evolves with increased pattern exposure, and is predictive of learning performance. The manifestation of learning that is revealed, not in stimulus processing but in the blank interval between stimuli, makes a direct link between the fields of statistical learning on the one hand and either prediction or consolidation on the other hand, suggesting a possible mechanistic account of visual statistical learning.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades statistical learning (SL) has evolved into a key explanatory mechanism underlying the incidental learning of regularities across different domains of cognition, such as language, visual and auditory perception, and memory. Yet SL has mainly been investigated as an independent research area, separated from the primary study of the relevant cognitive domains. The aim of this special issue is to foster a bilateral integration of SL research with cognitive science: not only should domain-relevant evidence about the complexity of real-world input become more tightly integrated into SL research, but non-SL studies should also carefully consider the nature and range of statistical regularities that may affect learning and processing in a given domain. Four papers on reading in this volume demonstrate that such integration can lead to a better understanding of reading, while also revealing the complexity and abundance of different statistical patterns present in printed text. Moving beyond disciplinary boundaries has the promise to broaden the focus of SL research beyond simple artificial patterns, to examine the rich and subtle intricacies of real-world cognition. A final paper on the neurobiological underpinnings of SL and the consolidation of learned statistical regularities further illustrates what might be gained from a better integration of SL and memory research. We conclude by discussing possible directions for taking an integrative approach to SL forward.},

However, the (language-related) basis for such proposals is often restricted to findings on English. Here, we argue that an extension of the database to other languages can shed new light on the types of mechanisms that an adequate account of Broca’s region should be equipped to deal with. This becomes most readily apparent in the domain of word order variations, which we examined in German verb-final sentences using event-related fMRI. Our results showed that activation in the pars opercularis – a core subregion of Broca’s area – was not only modulated by the relative ordering of subject and object, but also by a further factor known to affect word order in a number of languages, namely referentiality. Notably, the finding provides the first demonstration of a word order-related activation difference within subject-initial sentences in this region. Additional parametric analyses using individual behavioral data as predictors further attest to the independence of the pars opercularis activation from: (a) sentence acceptability, and (b) difficulty in performing the experimental (judgment) task. We argue that these and related findings attest to the need for a processing mechanism that can manipulate predicate-independent, interacting and hierarchically structured relational representations during real time comprehension. These properties pose a challenge to existing accounts of pars opercularis function.},

One challenge to this type of research is the fact that languages vary in the most salient symptoms of SLI. This study focuses on Italian.Aims: To determine whether three measures — the use of third‐person plural inflections, the use of direct‐object clitics and non‐word repetition — are successful in distinguishing Italian‐speaking children with SLI from their typically developing peers.Methods \& Procedures: Eleven preschool‐aged children with SLI, 11 same‐age typically developing peers and 11 younger typically developing children participated in the study. The third‐person plural inflection and direct‐object clitic tasks required the children to describe drawings in response to prompts provided by the examiner. In the non‐word repetition task, the children repeated non‐words ranging from one to four syllables in length.Outcomes \& Results: All three measures proved successful either singly or in combination, with direct‐object clitics and non‐word repetition showing the highest sensitivity and specificity.Conclusions: Additional research should be pursued to replicate and extend these findings. Along with the potential clinical value of the findings, the results suggest that difficulties with non‐final weak syllables — a problem that would adversely affect all three measures — may be an important part of the SLI profile in Italian.},

The goal of this study was to analyze language discrimination capacities in 4-month-old bilingual infants simultaneously exposed to 2 Romance languages belonging to the same rhythmic category, Spanish and Catalan. Using a familiarization-preference procedure, 2 groups of bilingual-to-be infants showed a capacity to discriminate between these 2 familial languages. Moreover, when compared with 2 groups of infants from monolingual environments, the size of the observed effects was the same. These results can be taken as initial evidence of an early capacity to distinguish languages in simultaneous bilingual exposure, thus challenging the hypothesis that language discrimination capacities are delayed in bilinguals.},

  abstract = {Overlaps in form and meaning between morphologically related words have led to ambiguities in interpreting priming effects in studies of lexical organization. In Semitic languages like Arabic, however, linguistic analysis proposes that one of the three component morphemes of a surface word is the CV-Skeleton, an abstract prosodic unit coding the phonological shape of the surface word and its primary syntactic function, which has no surface phonetic content (McCarthy, J. J. (1981). A prosodic theory of non-concatenative morphology, Linguistic Inquiry, 12 373–418). The other two morphemes are proposed to be the vocalic melody, which conveys additional syntactic information, and the root, which defines meaning. In three experiments using masked, cross-modal, and auditory–auditory priming we examined the role of the vocalic melody and the CV-Skeleton as potential morphemic units in the processing and representation of Arabic words. Prime/target pairs sharing the vocalic melody but not the CV-Skeleton consistently failed to prime. In contrast, word pairs sharing only the CV-Skeleton primed reliably throughout, with the amount of priming being as large as that observed between word pattern pairs sharing both vocalic melody and CV-Skeleton. Priming between morphologically related words can be observed when there is no overlap either in meaning or in surface phonetic form.},

  abstract = {This study probes the effects of allomorphy on access to Arabic roots and word patterns in two cross-modal priming experiments. Experiment 1 used strong roots which undergo no allomorphy, and weak roots which undergo allomorphy and surface with only two of their three consonants in some derivations. Word pairs sharing a root morpheme prime each other reliably not only when the root was strong (e.g., [muʃaarikun]/[ʃaaraka] participant/participate), but also when it was weak (e.g., [ittifaaqun]/[waafaqa] agreement–agree, where the weak root \{wfq\} surfaces fully in the target but not the prime). This facilitation occurred even when the weak root surfaced with different semantic meanings across prime and target (e.g., [ittiʒaahun]/[waaʒaha] destination/confront). Experiment 2 assessed the effects of allomorphy on word pattern processing, comparing word pairs where the word pattern is transparently realised in both prime and target (e.g., [intaʃara]/[iħtamala] spread/bear], with pairs which share the same underlying word pattern but where a weak root triggers an assimilation process in the prime (e.g., [ittaħada]/[ibtasama] unite/smile). This assimilation process does not disrupt the CV-structure of the word pattern, in contrast to a third condition where this is disrupted in both prime and target (e.g., [daara]/[qaala] turn around/say). Strong priming effects were observed in the first two conditions but not in the third. The bearing of these findings on models of lexical processing and representation is discussed.},

  abstract = {There are two views about morphology, the aspect of language concerned with the internal structure of words. One view holds that morphology is a domain of knowledge with a specific type of neurocognitive representation supported by specific brain mechanisms lateralized to left fronto-temporal cortex. The alternate view characterizes morphological effects as being a by-product of the correlation between form and meaning and where no brain area is predicted to subserve morphological processing per se. Here we provided evidence from Arabic that morphemes do have specific memory traces, which differ as a function of their functional properties. In an MMN study, we showed that the abstract consonantal root, which conveys semantic meaning (similarly to monomorphemic content words in English), elicits an MMN starting from 160 msec after the deviation point, whereas the abstract vocalic word pattern, which plays a range of grammatical roles, elicits an MMN response starting from 250 msec after the deviation point. Topographically, the root MMN has a symmetric fronto-central distribution, whereas the word pattern MMN lateralizes significantly to the left, indicating stronger involvement of left peri-sylvian areas. In languages with rich morphologies, morphemic processing seems to be supported by distinct neural networks, thereby providing evidence for a specific neuronal basis for morphology as part of the cerebral language machinery.},

  abstract = {Semitic morphology is based on the combination of two abstract discontinuous morphemes, the word pattern and the root. The word pattern specifies the phonological structure and morpho-syntactic properties of the surface form, while the consonantal root conveys core semantic information. Both units play a crucial role in processing Semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew. Here we use incremental masked priming to probe the time-course of word pattern and root activation in reading Arabic deverbal nouns and verbs. The morphological (word pattern and root), orthographic, and semantic relationship between prime and targets is varied over four stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) (32, 48, 64, and 80 ms). Results show distinctive patterns of activation for the two morphemic entities. Word pattern effects are transient, and detectable only at SOAs 48 and 64 in deverbal nouns and SOA 48 in verbs. Root effects are strong at all SOAs. This may reflect differences in the timing with which word pattern and root information can be extracted from the orthographic input, as well as differences in the roles of these morphemes in building internal lexical representations. Both types of morphemic effect contrast strongly with the effects of orthographic and semantic primes, where reliable facilitation is only obtained at the longest SOA (80 ms). The general pattern of results is consistent with the view that morphological effects in Semitic languages represent distinct structural characteristics of the language.},

  abstract = {Standard views of morphology in Modern Standard Arabic hold that surface word forms comprise at least 2 morphemes: a 3-consonantal root conveying semantic meaning and a word pattern carrying syntactic information. An alternative account claims that semantic information is carried by a bi-consonantal morphological unit called the etymon. Accordingly, in the form [batara] the core meaning is carried not by the tri-consonantal root morpheme btr but by the etymon morpheme b,t which surfaces in other forms like [batta] "sever," [batala] "cut off" with the same meaning "cutting." Previous experimental research in Semitic languages has assumed the tri-consonantal root/word pattern approach. In cross-modal and masked priming experiments we ask whether the etymon, as a more fine-grained 2-consonantal morphological unit, can yield the morphological priming effects typically obtained with tri-consonantal root morphemes. The results clearly show that 2 words sharing an etymon do facilitate each other both in cross-modal and masked priming even though they do not share a root, controlling for semantic and for form overlap effects. The bearing of these results on theories of morphological processing and representation is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Because of its distinctive experience, the origins and characteristics of insight have received considerable attention historically in psychological research. However, despite considerable progress in characterizing insight, the underlying mechanisms remain mysterious. We argue that research on insight could be greatly advanced by supplementing traditional insight research, which depends on a few complex problems, with paradigms common in other domains of cognitive science. We describe a large set of mini-insight problems to which multiple methods can be applied, together with subjective reports to identify insight problem-solving. Behavioral priming and neuroimaging methods are providing evidence about what, where, and how neural activity occurs during insight. Such evidence constrains theories of component processes, and will help to demystify insight.},

The authors propose an evolutionary path based on structure-mapping theory. This hypothesis--the career of metaphor--postulates a shift in mode of mapping from comparison to categorization as metaphors are conventionalized. Moreover, as demonstrated by 3 experiments, this processing shift is reflected in the very language that people use to make figurative assertions. The career of metaphor hypothesis offers a unified theoretical framework that can resolve the debate between comparison and categorization models of metaphor. This account further suggests that whether metaphors are processed directly or indirectly, and whether they operate at the level of individual concepts or entire conceptual domains, will depend both on their degree of conventionality and on their linguistic form.

In this way, literacy can be taught as a scientific subject, where children form and test hypotheses about how their spelling system works. First, we review arguments put forward in support of phonics and then highlight significant problems with both theory and data. Second, we review the linguistics of English spellings and show that spellings are highly logical once all the relevant sublexical constraints are considered. Third, we provide theoretical and empirical arguments in support of the hypothesis that instruction should target all the cognitive skills necessary to understand the logic of the English spelling system.},

When compared with normally achieving children who read nonwords and exception words equally well, Chinese readers scored as well as these children on word identification, regular word reading, orthographic choice, spelling, reading comprehension, phonological sensitivity, and verbal ability and scored better on exception word reading. Chinese readers also used rhyme-based analogies to read nonwords derived from high-frequency exception words just as often as did these children. As predicted, Phoenician and Chinese readers adopted somewhat different strategies in reading ambiguous nonwords constructed by analogy to high-frequency exception words. Phoenician readers were more likely than Chinese readers to read ambiguous monosyllabic nonwords via context-free grapheme–phoneme correspondences and were less likely to read disyllabic nonwords by analogy to high-frequency analogues. Although the Chinese reading style was more common than the Phoenician style in normally achieving fourth graders, there were similar numbers of poor readers with phonological dyslexia (identifying nonwords significantly more accurately than exception words) and surface dyslexia (showing the reverse pattern), although surface dyslexia was more common in the severely disabled readers.

In this paradigm, a prime is presented prior to the definition of a target word, and the task is to produce the target word. The authors view the process of word retrieval as requiring access from a conceptually organized semantic network to an orthographically and phonemically organized lexical network. Primes that were orthographically (and phonemically) related to the target words facilitated word retrieval. Both semantically related and unrelated primes inhibited word retrieval. Inhibition from both of these sources is attributed in part to the orthographic unrelatedness of these primes. This explanation is consistent with data from several other word retrieval studies (e.g., A. S. Brown [see PA, Vol 64:4730]). The word retrieval task is contrasted with the lexical decision task. It is suggested that the differential effects of orthographic and semantic priming in word retrieval and lexical decision are due to differences in retrieval processing between the 2 tasks.

To test these hypotheses directly we covaried increases in the nonlinguistic complexity of spoken words [presence or absence of an embedded stem, e.g., claim (clay)] with variations in their linguistic complexity (presence of inflectional affixes, e.g., play+ed). Nonlinguistic complexity, generated by the on-line competition between the full word and its onset-embedded stem, was found to activate both right and left fronto-temporal brain regions, including bilateral BA45 and -47. Linguistic complexity activated left-lateralized inferior frontal areas only, primarily in BA45. This contrast reflects a differentiation between the functional roles of a bilateral system, which supports the basic mapping from sound to lexical meaning, and a language-specific left-lateralized system that supports core decompositional and combinatorial processes invoked by linguistically complex inputs. These differences can be related to the neurobiological foundations of human language and underline the importance of bihemispheric systems in supporting the dynamic processing and interpretation of spoken inputs.

  abstract = {The role of morphological structure in word recognition raises issues about the nature and structure of the language system. One major issue is whether morphological factors provide an independent principle for lexical organization and processing, or whether morphological effects can be reduced to the joint contribution of form and meaning. The independence of form, meaning, and morphological structure can be directly investigated using derivationally complex words, because derived words can share form but need not share meaning (e.g., archer-arch). We used an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm to investigate priming between pairs of words that potentially shared a stem, where this link was either semantically transparent (e.g., bravely-brave) or opaque (e.g., archer-arch). These morphologically related pairs were contrasted with identity priming (e.g., mist-mist) and priming for pairs of words that shared only form (e.g., scandal-scan) or meaning (e.g., accuse-blame). Morphologically related words produced significantly reduced activation in left frontal regions, whether the pairs were semantically transparent or opaque. The effect was not found for any of the control conditions (identity, form, or meaning). Morphological effects were observed separately from processing form and meaning and we propose that they reflect segmentation of complex derived words, a process triggered by surface morphological structure of complex words.

  abstract = {Current research suggests that language comprehension engages two joint but functionally distinguishable neurobiological processes: a distributed bilateral system, which supports general perceptual and interpretative processes underpinning speech comprehension, and a left hemisphere (LH) frontotemporal system, selectively tuned to the processing of combinatorial grammatical sequences, such as regularly inflected verbs in English [Marslen-Wilson, W. D., \& Tyler, L. K. Morphology, language and the brain: The decompositional substrate for language comprehension. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences, 362, 823–836, 2007]. Here we investigated how English derivationally complex words engage these systems, asking whether they selectively activate the LH system in the same way as inflections or whether they primarily engage the bilateral system that support nondecompositional access. In an fMRI study, we saw no evidence for selective activation of the LH frontotemporal system, even for highly transparent forms like bravely. Instead, a combination of univariate and multivariate analyses revealed the engagement of a distributed bilateral system, modulated by factors of perceptual complexity and semantic transparency. We discuss the implications for theories of the processing and representation of English derivational morphology and highlight the importance of neurobiological constraints in understanding these processes.},

Within the framework of the brain network that supports language comprehension, we argue that complex words created by regular and rule-based combinations, such as regular inflections in English (e.g. played, jumps), engage a left-lateralized frontotemporal subsystem, specialized for grammatical computations. In contrast, processing of lexicalized and unpredictable complexity, present in derived words (e.g. bravely, warmth), engages a bilateral subsystem, which underpins whole-word, stem-based lexical access. We suggest a potential neurobiological framework for this proposed organization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

  abstract = {The lack of consensus on a true gender-neutral singular personal pronoun for the third person in standard English has led to many continuing attempts to reform the language to be more gender-neutral and to accurately refer to nonbinary persons. Singular they has a long history of use, but continues to draw criticism from prescriptivist commentators. Recent research has found that those who endorse more binary gender ideology tend to reject singular they more often than those who hold more egalitarian gender views. The present study directly compared the contributions of linguistic prescriptivism and sexism to speakers' judgments in order to determine whether resistance to singular they is driven more by strict adherence to standard grammar or instead by attitudes about gender which are at odds with the language itself. American English speakers rated the grammaticality of sentences containing singular they and also responded to measures of linguistic prescriptivism and hostile and benevolent sexism. Results indicate that resistance to gender-neutral language is driven by sexist (but not necessarily hostile) attitudes about gender as much as by linguistic conservatism, though both contribute to grammatical judgments. Such resistance is particularly hostile to innovations that challenge the gender binary. These results carry implications for both theories of pronoun reference and language reform initiatives.},

  abstract = {An important issue in current research on dyslexia is to what extent the reading deficits of dyslexic children are related to processing deficits at the sensory-visual level, at the cognitive-linguistic level or at both levels. Event-related potential mapping distinguishes the split-second processing stages during reading as brief brain-electric micro-states and can address this issue directly. Previously, conventional studies have yielded inconsistent patterns of event-related potential differences between dyslexic and control children, but most of these discrepancies could result from the widely differing methodologies. We used event-related potential mapping during silent reading of correct and incorrect sentence endings to examine the neurophysiology of sensory and cognitive processes in dyslexic and control children (n = 12/group). Selected findings from spatio-temporal analyses of map strength (global field power), map latency and map topography measured in three dimensions are presented. Both sensory-visual processes in a P110 micro-state and cognitive-linguistic processes in an early N400 micro-state were affected in dyslexic children, and processing delays, as well as qualitatively different patterns of neural activation, were found. Our findings also indicated that the use of specific cognitive tasks and of appropriate spatio-temporal analyses of event-related map series are critical factors for successful identification of specific processing deficits in brain mapping studies.},

  abstract = {Despite the current push toward the practice of evidence-based medicine and comparative effectiveness research, clinicians' decisions may be influenced not only by evidence, but also by cognitive biases. A cognitive bias describes a tendency to make systematic errors in certain circumstances based on cognitive factors rather than evidence. Though health care providers have been shown in several studies to be susceptible to a variety of types of cognitive biases, research on the role of the sunk-cost bias in clinical decision-making is extremely limited. The sunk-cost bias is the tendency to pursue a course of action, even after it has proved to be suboptimal, because resources have been invested in that course of action. This study explores whether health care providers' medical treatment recommendations are affected by prior investments in a course of treatment. Specifically, we surveyed 389 health care providers in a large urban medical center in the United States during August 2009. We asked participants to make a treatment recommendation based on one of four hypothetical clinical scenarios that varied in the source and type of prior investment described. By comparing recommendations across scenarios, we found that providers did not demonstrate a sunk-cost effect; rather, they demonstrated a significant tendency to over-compensate for the effect. In addition, we found that more than one in ten health care providers recommended continuation of an ineffective treatment.},

  abstract = {Many researchers in the behavioral sciences depend on research software that presents stimuli, and records response times, with sub-millisecond precision. There are a large number of software packages with which to conduct these behavioral experiments and measure response times and performance of participants. Very little information is available, however, on what timing performance they achieve in practice. Here we report a wide-ranging study looking at the precision and accuracy of visual and auditory stimulus timing and response times, measured with a Black Box Toolkit. We compared a range of popular packages: PsychoPy, E-Prime®, NBS Presentation®, Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame, Expyriment, Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where possible, the packages were tested on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, and in a range of browsers for the online studies, to try to identify common patterns in performance. Among the lab-based experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime provided the best timing, all with mean precision under 1 millisecond across the visual, audio and response measures. OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the board, but most notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that precision was generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than Windows, and that macOS was the worst, at least for visual stimuli, for all packages. Online studies did not deliver the same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly more variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla, broadly the best performers, were achieving very close to millisecond precision on several browser/operating system combinations. For response times (measured using a high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved precision at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy achieving a precision under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable variability between OS/browser combinations, especially in audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise aspect of the browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with due thought about the sources of variability that result. The results, from over 110,000 trials, highlight the wide range of timing qualities that can occur even in these dedicated software packages for the task. We stress the importance of scientists making their own timing validation measurements for their own stimuli and computer configuration.},

Organize this work around a framework based on the physical organization of the body. METHODS: Pointers to individual research efforts were obtained through the HBP home page as well as personal contracts from HBP annual meetings. References from these sources were followed to find closely related work. The individual research efforts were then studied and characterized. RESULTS: The subject of the review is the intersection of neuroinformatics (information about the brain), imaging informatics (information about images), and structural informatics (information about the physical structure of the body). Of the 30 funded projects currently listed on the HBP web site, at least 22 make heavy use of images. These projects are described in terms of broad categories of structural imaging, functional imaging, and image-based brain information systems. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the most complex entity known (the brain) gives rise to many interesting and difficult problems in informatics and computer science. Although much progress has been made by HBP and other neuroinformatics researchers, a great many problems remain that will require substantial informatics research efforts. Thus, the HPB can and should be seen as an excellent driving application area for biomedical informatics research.},

  abstract = {For more than two decades now, cognitive science has been making overtures to literature and literary studies. Only recently, however, cognitive linguistics and poetics seem to be moving towards a more serious and reciprocal type of interdisciplinarity. In coupling cognitive linguistics and poetics, cognitive poeticians aim to offer cognitive readings of literary texts and formulate specific hypotheses concerning the relationship between aesthetic meaning effects and patterns in the cognitive construal and processing of literary texts. One of the basic assumptions of the endeavour is that some of the key topics in poetics (such as the construction of text worlds, characterization, narrative perspective, distancing discourse, etc.) may be fruitfully approached by applying cognitive linguistic concepts and insights (such as embodied cognition, metaphor, mental spaces, iconicity, construction grammar, figure/ground alignment, etc.), in an attempt to support, enrich or adjust ‘traditional’ poetic analysis. Conversely, the tradition of poetics may support, frame or call into question insights form cognitive linguistics. In order to capture the goals, gains and gaps of this rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of research, this volume brings together some of the key players and critics of cognitive poetics. The eleven chapters are grouped into four major sections, each dealing with central concerns of the field: (i) the cognitive mechanisms, discursive means and mental products related to narrativity (Semino, Herman, Culpeper); (ii) the different incarnations of the concept of figure in cognitive poetics (Freeman, Steen, Tsur); (iii) the procedures that are meant to express or create discursive attitudes, like humour, irony or distance in general (Antonopoulou and Nikiforidou, Dancygier and Vandelanotte, Giora et al.); and (iv) a critical assessment of the current state of affairs in cognitive poetics, and more specifically the incorporation of insights from cognitive linguistics as only one of the contributing fields in the interdisciplinary conglomerate of cognitive science (Louwerse and Van Peer, Sternberg).The ensuing dialogue between cognitive and literary partners, as well as between advocates and opponents, is promoted through the use of short response articles included after ten chapters of the volume.

  abstract = {We tested current models of morphological processing in reading with data from four visual lexical decision experiments using German compounds and monomorphemic words. Triplets of two semantically transparent noun-noun compounds and one monomorphemic noun were used in Experiments 1a and 1b. Stimuli within a triplet were matched for full-form frequency. The frequency of the compounds’ constituents was varied. The compounds of a triplet shared one constituent, while the frequency of the unshared constituent was either high or low, but always higher than full-form frequency. Reactions were faster to compounds with high-frequency constituents than to compounds with low-frequency constituents, while the latter did not differ from the monomorphemic words. This pattern was not influenced by task difficulty, induced by the type of pseudocompounds used. Pseudocompounds were either created by altering letters of an existing compound (easy pseudocompound, Experiment 1a) or by combining two free morphemes into a non-existing, but morphologically legal, compound (difficult pseudocompound, Experiment 1b). In Experiments 2a and 2b, frequency-matched pairs of semantically opaque noun-noun compounds and simple nouns were tested. In Experiment 2a, with easy pseudocompounds (of the same type as in Experiment 1a), a reaction-time advantage for compounds over monomorphemic words was again observed. This advantage disappeared in Experiment 2b, where difficult pseudocompounds were used. Although a dual-route might account for the data, the findings are best understood in terms of decomposition of low-frequency complex words prior to lexical access, followed by processing costs due to the recombination of morphemes for meaning access. These processing costs vary as a function of intrinsic factors such as semantic transparency, or external factors such as the difficulty of the experimental task.

  abstract = {It is not unusual for developmental psychologists to become frustrated with the theory of universal grammar (UG), whose proponents have tended to dismiss most research on children's language production and comprehension as irrelevant to explaining how human languages are acquired. This is because children's actual linguistic behaviour is presumed to reflect factors besides their grammatical competence, rendering most methods of sampling linguistic behaviour unsuitable for evaluating UG theory. This means, in practice, that UG proponents do not view performance errors as evidence against their hypothesis that grammatical knowledge is largely innate. When children perform at ceiling on a given task, this is usually taken as proof of their adultlike grammatical competence, while poor performance is dismissed as due to research design flaws or limitations in information processing capacities (e.g. working memory). Crain \& Thornton (1998) attempt to eliminate what they consider to be post hoc processing accounts of children's linguistic behaviour by arguing, counter to Chomsky (1965) and many others, that children and adults share identical language processing mechanisms, and that linguistic performance directly reflects grammatical competence. Therefore, if UG principles are available from an early age, child and adult performance should be the same when tasks are properly constructed to avoid extra-linguistic demand characteristics (excepting adult–child differences predicted by parameter-setting or maturational models). It should not be surprising then that some psycholinguists, such as Drozd (target article), would find C\&T to be misguided with respect to these issues, because children's linguistic behaviour surely differs from adults' in seemingly unpredictable ways.},

To assess the impact of automatic LA processes on the N400, the effect of masked presentations (MPs) and unmasked presentations (UMPs) of a prime on the N400 to a following target was compared. The RT study showed a significant semantic priming effect under both UMPs and MPs of the prime.

Townsend and Ashby (1978, 1983) proposed the inverse efficiency score (IES) as a way to combine both measures and, hence, to provide a better summary of the findings. In this article we examine the usefulness of IES by applying it to existing datasets. Although IES does give a better summary of the findings in some cases, mostly the variance of the measure is increased to such an extent that it becomes less interesting. Against our initial hopes, we have to conclude that it is not a good idea to limit the statistical analyses to IES without further checking the data.},

We specifically examined the ERP correlates of producing morphologically complex words in 8-year-olds, 12-year-olds and adults, by recording ERPs during the silent production of compounds with plural or singular modifiers. Results for both children and adults revealed a negativity in response to compounds produced from regular plural forms when compared to compounds formed from irregular plurals, indicating a highly specific brain response to a subtle linguistic contrast. Although children performed behaviourally with an adult-like pattern in the task, we found a broader distribution and a considerably later latency in children's brain potentials than in adults’, indicating that even in late childhood the brain networks involved in language processing are subject to subtle developmental changes.},

This study reviews the sample size guideline for Cronbach’s alpha test. Methods Manual sample size calculation using Microsoft Excel software and sample size tables were tabulated based on a single coefficient alpha and the comparison of two coefficients alpha. Results For a single coefficient alpha test, the approach by assuming the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient equals to zero in the null hypothesis will yield a smaller sample size of less than 30 to achieve a minimum desired effect size of 0.7. However, setting the coefficient of Cronbach’s alpha larger than zero in the null hypothesis could be necessary and this will yield larger sample size. For comparison of two coefficients of Cronbach’s alpha, a larger sample size is needed when testing for smaller effect sizes. Conclusions In the assessment of the internal consistency of an instrument, the present study proposed the Cronbach’s alpha’s coefficient to be set at 0.5 in the null hypothesis and hence larger sample size is needed. For comparison of two coefficients’ of Cronbach’s alpha, justification is needed whether testing for extremely low and extremely large effect sizes are scientifically necessary.},

  abstract = {Using the H215O PET method, we investigated whether previous findings of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes in the polar and superior rostral aspects of the frontal lobes (principally Brodmann’s area (BA) 10) during prospective memory (PM) paradigms (i.e. those involving carrying out an intended action after a delay) can be attributed merely to the greater difficulty of such tasks over the baseline conditions typically employed. Three different tasks were administered under four conditions: baseline simple RT; attention-demanding ongoing task only; ongoing task plus a delayed intention (unpracticed); ongoing task plus delayed intention (practiced). Under prospective memory conditions, we found significant rCBF decreases in the superior medial aspects of the rostral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) relative to the baseline or ongoing task only conditions. However more lateral aspects of area 10 (plus the medio-dorsal thalamus) showed the opposite pattern, with rCBF increases in the prospective memory conditions relative to the other conditions. These patterns were broadly replicated over all three tasks. Since both the medial and lateral rostral regions showed: (a) instances where rCBF was lower during a more effortful condition (as estimated by increased RTs and error rates) than in a less effortful one; and (b) there was no correlation between rCBF and RT durations or number of errors in these regions, a simple task difficulty explanation of the rCBF changes in the rostral aspects of the frontal lobes during prospective memory tasks is rejected. Instead, the favoured explanation concentrates upon the particular processing demands made by these situations irrespective of the precise stimuli used or the exact nature of the intention. Moreover, the results suggest different roles for medial and lateral rostral prefrontal cortex, with the former involved in suppressing internally-generated thought, and the latter in maintaining it.},

Here, we argue that the actual temporal resolution of conventional (scalp potentials) EEG is overestimated, and that volume conduction, the main cause of the poor spatial resolution of EEG, also distorts the recovered time course of the underlying sources at scalp level, and hence degrades the actual temporal resolution of EEG. While Current Source Density (CSD) estimates, through the Surface Laplacian (SL) computation, are well known to dramatically reduce volume conduction effects and hence improve EEG spatial resolution, its positive impact on EEG temporal resolution is much less recognized. In two simulation studies, we first show how volume conduction and reference electrodes distort the scalp potential time course, and how SL transform provides a much better spatio-temporal description. We then exemplify similar effects on two empirical datasets. We show how the time courses of the scalp potentials mis-estimate the latencies of the relevant brain events and that CSD provides a much richer, and much more accurate, view of the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity.},

Participants had significantly higher hit rates and significantly lower miss rates after the confectionery snack. In addition, false alarm rates increased as a function of time for the placebo condition and decreased for the confectionery condition. Thus, the confectionery snack enhanced ability to stay on task for an extended period of time, enabling the children to more accurately identify target information, as well as correctly reject nontarget information. Analysis of the types of errors made also revealed that when the children were in the confectionery condition they were less likely to make more glaring errors.

  abstract = {Objective: The effects of stimulus size, duration and eccentricity on the visual gamma-band response (GBR) in human EEG were investigated and compared to visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in order to differentiate in future (and past) experiments whether changes in GBRs are due to stimulus-related (exogenous) or cognitive effects. Methods: EEG was recorded from 23 subjects while they performed a simple choice reaction time task requiring discrimination of squares and circles. In separate blocks stimulus size, duration, and eccentricity were manipulated. EEG was recorded from 64 electrodes. A wavelet transform based on Morlet wavelets was employed for the analysis of gamma-band activity. Results: Amplitude of the GBR was diminished for small and peripheral stimuli. With short stimulus durations ON and OFF responses of the GBR merged into one peak. In comparison, VEP amplitudes were less susceptible to stimulus features. In contrast to VEP latencies, however, GBR latency did not show a lateralization for eccentric stimuli. Conclusions: In addition to previous experiments which have shown a modulation of the GBR by various cognitive processes, the present results demonstrate the susceptibility of the GBR in human EEG to exogenous factors, as numerous intracortical recordings in non-human primates have shown before. The results suggest that the human GBR resides in early visual areas. Significance: The demonstration of the susceptibility of the GBR to stimulus properties implies that studies aimed at exploring the involvement of the GBR in information processing have to be designed carefully. It also constrains the localization of the human GBR.},

It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances under the pressure of newer formations.

Whereas the basic tenet of MMN is appealing, several issues-of-contention remain to be solved before this event related potential (ERP) can be applicable for routine clinical use. These issues include the consistent identification of MMN within individuals (vs. groups), its stability over time, and its reportedly poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Herein, we focus on the issue of SNR, by comparing and contrasting SNR of MMN with other long latency auditory ERPs.},

Since Italian is a PRO-DROP language, the authors expect that adult-to-child speech will show a bias towards a more salient semantic and morphological significance of verbs relative to nouns. The authors expect that verbs will more likely occupy the sentence-initial position, and have more morphological inflections relative to nouns. Mother-to-child speech was coded for type and token frequency, utterance position, and morphological variation of nouns and verbs. The results confirm our predictions. Namely, Italian-speaking mothers produced verb types and tokens more frequently than noun types and tokens, they placed verbs more frequently than nouns in salient utterance position, and they morphologically marked verb stems.

Lantolf, Professor of Applied Linguistics, The Pennsylvania State University.This book reports research into metaphor in use with school students. The setting for the research is a UK school and the participants are around ten years old, with their first language well established but still developing concepts and understandings. Close examination of a corpus of classroom spoken discourse reveals how metaphor is employed by their teachers, not just in explaining ideas, but, in managing and mediating the activity of the classroom and the learning of the students. Particular issues discussed include: the problems of identifying metaphors in spoken discourse, the conventionalism of metaphors in the discourse of socio-cultural groups, and how a socio-cultural approach can account for systematicity in metaphor use.},

The claim of the DP framework is that such behavior is necessary to achieve high levels of expert performance. The proponents of the framework reject evidence that suggests that other variables are also necessary to achieve high levels of expert performance, or they claim that the relationship between those variables and expert performance is mediated by DP. Therefore, the DP framework also implies that DP is sufficient to achieve high levels of expert performance. We test these claims by reviewing studies on chess expertise. We found strong evidence that abundant DP is necessary (but not sufficient) and estimated that the minimum requirement to achieve master level is 3,000 hours of DP. We also review evidence showing that other factors play a role in chess skill: general cognitive abilities, sensitive period, handedness, and season of birth.},

We review the concept of working memory as a short-duration system in which small amounts of information are simultaneously stored and manipulated in the service of accomplishing a task. We summarize the argument that syntactic processing in sentence comprehension requires such a storage and computational system. We then ask whether the working memory system used in syntactic processing is the same as that used in verbally mediated tasks that involve conscious controlled processing. Evidence is brought to bear from various sources: the relationship between individual differences in working memory and individual differences in the efficiency of syntactic processing; the effect of concurrent verbal memory load on syntactic processing; and syntactic processing in patients with poor short-term memory, patients with poor working memory, and patients with aphasia. Experimental results from these normal subjects and patients with various brain lesions converge on the conclusion that there is a specialization in the verbal working memory system for assigning the syntactic structure of a sentence and using that structure in determining sentence meaning that is separate from the working memory system underlying the use of sentence meaning to accomplish other functions. We present a theory of the divisions of the verbal working memory system and suggestions regarding its neural basis.},

The specific form of aphasia observed in a patient is determined by the locus of cerebral insult. However, given the complexity of the language processing system, involving as it does complex linguistic mechanisms—phonological, lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic—as well as associated cognitive systems (e.g., working memory), a vast number of different forms of aphasia may be observed. Each form of aphasia observed is presumed to result from the particular type of damage to a component or combination of components of the language processing system. It is unrealistic, therefore, in the limited space available here, to attempt a review of the full range of possible language deficits in aphasia. A more manageable task is to focus the review on just one subsystem of the language faculty. This review will focus on the lexical system.},

The subject's spelling performance was affected by verious graphotactic factors, such as the distinction between consonant and vowel and graphosyllabic structure. For example, while the subject produced many consonant and vowel dedeletion errors when these were part of consonant and vowel clusters, respectively (e.g., sfondo → sondo; guinta → gunta), deletions were virtually never produced for single consonants flanked by two vowels (e.g., onesto oesto) or for single vowels flanked by two consonants (e.g., tirare trare). The dedmonstration that graphosyllabic factors affect spelling performance disconfirms the hypothesis that graphemic representations consist simply of linearly ordered sets of graphemes. It is concluded that graphemic representations are multidimensional structures: one dimension specifies the grapheme identities that comprise the spelling of a word; a second dimension specifies the consonant/vowel status of the graphemes; a third dimension represents the graphosyllabic structure of the grapheme string; and, a fourth dimension provides information about geminate features.},

More specifically, its aim is to clarify the relations between science as the investigation of 'truths' that people hold at a particular time, on the one hand, and art as carrier of these truths into the 'emotional' realm of the people, on the other. The goal is simple; as is the method. The goal is to provide a way of teaching the humanities based on the aesthetic.[1] The method uses the figures chosen to act as a foil to each other, so that what seems to be a parallel of contrasts between Darwin and Gauguin, is, in fact, an equilibrium of the sensual and the rational. [2] The specific point that the paper argues is this: if teaching the humanities is tied pedagogically to art, then science, as well as the other disciplines, will join the curriculum in an integral way so as to contribute to the complete education of the student: physical, intellectual, moral, and spiritual. The first section of the paper develops the education of reason or mind in the life and thoughts of Charles Darwin. My remarks here will be limited primarily, but not exclusively, to his autobiography. The second part clarifies the education of the senses in the thoughts of Paul Gauguin.},

We have adapted one such rating scale, the Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS), to be used with British children aged 8–13. In this study, we assess the scale's reliability, factor structure, and divergent validity. The modified AMAS (mAMAS) was administered to a very large (n = 1746) cohort of British children and adolescents. This large sample size meant that as well as conducting confirmatory factor analysis on the scale itself, we were also able to split the sample to conduct exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of items from the mAMAS alongside items from child test anxiety and general anxiety rating scales. Factor analysis of the mAMAS confirmed that it has the same underlying factor structure as the original AMAS, with subscales measuring anxiety about Learning and Evaluation in math. Furthermore, both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the mAMAS alongside scales measuring test anxiety and general anxiety showed that mAMAS items cluster onto one factor (perceived to represent MA). The mAMAS provides a valid and reliable scale for measuring MA in children and adolescents, from a younger age than is possible with the original AMAS. Results from this study also suggest that MA is truly a unique construct, separate from both test anxiety and general anxiety, even in childhood.},

Of importance is whether students can not only read and recognize the structure of morphologically complex words but also determine their meanings. This issue was addressed by investigating the relationship of third and fifth graders' awareness of the structure and meanings of derived words and the relationship of these forms of morphological awareness to word reading and reading comprehension. The results showed that awareness of structure was significantly related to the ability to define morphologically complex words; some aspects were also significantly related to the reading of derived words. The three morphology tasks accounted for significant variance in reading comprehension at both grade levels, but the contribution was stronger for the fifth than the third grade. It may be educationally noteworthy that morphological analysis contributed significantly to reading comprehension for the third graders because they are presumably just beginning to learn to read and understand morphologically complex words.},

The results indicate strong developmental trends in both the mastery of derivational morphology and the spelling of derived words; however, spelling performances lagged significantly behind the ability to generate the same words. Success generating and spelling derived words depended on the complexity of transformations between base and derived forms. Further, mastery of phonological and orthographic transformations most strongly distinguished the three grades in both spelling and generating derived words. Indications that the older students were using knowledge of morphemic structure in spelling derived words were found in analysis of the spelling of base and derived word pairs and the application of suffix addition rules.},

  abstract = {Derivational morphology is a cross-linguistically dominant mechanism for word formation, combining existing words with derivational affixes to create new word forms. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the representation and processing of such forms remain unclear. Recent cross-linguistic neuroimaging research suggests that derived words are stored and accessed as whole forms, without engaging the left-hemisphere perisylvian network associated with combinatorial processing of syntactically and inflectionally complex forms. Using fMRI with a 'simple listening' no-task procedure, we reexamine these suggestions in the context of the root-based combinatorially rich Italian lexicon to clarify the role of semantic transparency (between the derived form and its stem) and affix productivity in determining whether derived forms are decompositionally represented and which neural systems are involved. Combined univariate and multivariate analyses reveal a key role for semantic transparency, modulated by affix productivity. Opaque forms show strong cohort competition effects, especially for words with nonproductive suffixes (ventura, 'destiny'). The bilateral frontotemporal activity associated with these effects indicates that opaque derived words are processed as whole forms in the bihemispheric language system. Semantically transparent words with productive affixes (libreria, 'bookshop') showed no effects of lexical competition, suggesting morphologically structured co-representation of these derived forms and their stems, whereas transparent forms with nonproductive affixes (pineta, pine forest) show intermediate effects. Further multivariate analyses of the transparent derived forms revealed affix productivity effects selectively involving left inferior frontal regions, suggesting that the combinatorial and decompositional processes triggered by such forms can vary significantly across languages.

In Experiment 1, words and pseudowords were presented visually and colored so that there was a match or a mismatch between the syllable boundaries and the color boundaries. The results showed color-syllable congruency effects in the time window of the P200. Lexicality modulated the N400 amplitude, but no effects of this variable were obtained at the P200 window. In Experiment 2, high- and low-frequency words and pseudowords were presented in the congruent and incongruent conditions. The results again showed congruency effects at the P200 for low-frequency words and pseudowords, but not for high-frequency words. Lexicality and lexical frequency effects showed up at the N400 component. The results suggest a dissociation between syllabic and lexical effects with important consequences for models of visual word recognition.

The superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices are critical areas for action representation and are connected to the limbic system via the insula. Thus, the insula may be a critical relay from action representation to emotion. We used functional MRI while subjects were either imitating or simply observing emotional facial expressions. Imitation and observation of emotions activated a largely similar network of brain areas. Within this network, there was greater activity during imitation, compared with observation of emotions, in premotor areas including the inferior frontal cortex, as well as in the superior temporal cortex, insula, and amygdala. We understand what others feel by a mechanism of action representation that allows empathy and modulates our emotional content. The insula plays a fundamental role in this mechanism.},

  abstract = {2.1 Abstract Users of software systems acquire knowledge about the system and how to use it through experience, training, and imitation. Currently, there is a great deal of debate about exactly what users know about software. This knowledge may include one or more of the following:•simple rules that prescribe a sequence of actions that apply in certain conditions,•general methods that fit certain general situations and goals,•“mental models,” knowledge of the components of a system, their interconnection, and the processes that change the components; knowledge that forms the basis for users being able to construct reasonable actions; and explanations about why a set of actions is appropriate. Discovering what users know and how these different forms of knowledge fit together in learning and performance is important. It applies to the problem of designing systems and training programs so that the systems are easy to use and the learning is efficient. Research on the effects of different representations on ultimate performance is mixed. Research on exactly what users know is scattered. Analytical methods and techniques for representing what the user knows are sparse but growing. This paper reviews current work and through the review, identifies several important research needs:•Detail what kinds of mental representations people have of systems that allow them to behave appropriately in using the software.•Detail what a mental model would consist of and how a person would use it to decide what action to take next.•Produce evidence that people have and use mental models.•Determine the behaviors that would demonstrate a mental model's form and the operations used on the model.•Explore alternative views of goal-directed representations (e.g., so-called “sequence/method representations”) and detail the behavior predicted from them.•Expand the types of mental representations that may exist to include those that may not be mechanistic, such as algebraic systems and visual systems.•Determine how people intermix different representations in producing behavior.•Explore how knowledge about systems is acquired.•Determine how individual differences have an impact on learning of and performance on systems.•Explore the design of training sequences for systems.•Provide systems designers with tools to help them develop systems that evoke “good” representations in users.•Expand the task domain of this research to include more complex software.},

  abstract = {This study examines morphological awareness in developmental dyslexia. While the poor phonological awareness of dyslexic children has been related to their difficulty in handling the alphabetical principle, less is known about their morphological awareness, which also plays an important part in reading development. The aim of this study was to analyze in more detail the implications of the phonological impairments of dyslexics in dealing with larger units of language such as morphemes. First, the performance of dyslexic children in a series of morphological tasks was compared with the performance of children matched on reading-level and chronological age. In all the tasks, the dyslexic group performed below the chronological age control group, suggesting that morphological awareness cannot be developed entirely independently of reading experience and/or phonological skills. Comparisons with the reading-age control group indicated that, while the dyslexic children were poorer in the morphemic segmentation tasks, they performed normally for their reading level in the sentence completion tasks. Furthermore, they produced more derived words in the production task. This suggests that phonological impairments prevent the explicit segmentation of affixes while allowing the development of productive morphological knowledge. A second study compared dyslexic subgroups defined by their degree of phonological impairment. Our results suggest that dyslexics develop a certain type of morphological knowledge, which they use as a compensatory reading strategy.},

Research in psychological science has provided answers to many of these questions but, somewhat surprisingly, this research has been slow to make inroads into educational policy and practice. Instead, the field has been plagued by decades of “reading wars.” Even now, there remains a wide gap between the state of research knowledge about learning to read and the state of public understanding. The aim of this article is to fill this gap. We present a comprehensive tutorial review of the science of learning to read, spanning from children’s earliest alphabetic skills through to the fluent word recognition and skilled text comprehension characteristic of expert readers. We explain why phonics instruction is so central to learning in a writing system such as English. But we also move beyond phonics, reviewing research on what else children need to learn to become expert readers and considering how this might be translated into effective classroom practice. We call for an end to the reading wars and recommend an agenda for instruction and research in reading acquisition that is balanced, developmentally informed, and based on a deep understanding of how language and writing systems work.},

To become accurate and efficient readers of the English language, however, children need to do more than assemble or decode pronunciations on the basis of spelling-sound mappings.

However, for adults, this masked form-priming effect does not occur if the target looks like many other words (i.e. if it has many neighbours). The usual interpretation of this result is that the adult word recognition system is tuned to the differing discrimination demands of words: If a word looks like many others, a more precise recognition procedure is required than if it is orthographically distinctive. This theory has developmental implications: Children should show more form priming for high neighbourhood words than adults and should show a gradual reduction in priming as their written vocabularies become larger. Masked form priming was examined in three groups of developing readers, from grades 2, 4 and 6, and a group of adults. In a lexical decision task, the children showed significantly greater priming overall than the adults for high N words. However, the predicted gradual attenuation across age was not found. Supplementary analyses suggested that the adaptation to lexical density may not occur until a somewhat more advanced stage of reading than we had first expected.},

Reading, phonological, and morphological abilities were measured in 20 dyslexic and 20 non-dyslexic university students. The results confirmed the persistence of deficits in phonological but not morphological abilities, thereby revealing a dissociation in the development of these two skills.

  abstract = {This study investigates the role of probabilistic phonotactics in the processing of consonant clusters (as opposed to consonant-vowel sequences) and of complex words (as opposed to monomorphemic words) in two experiments of visual word recognition with masked fragment priming. Target words are more efficiently recognized when the transition probabilities between an initial fragment and the following segment in the target are high, but this effect is not equally distributed across all areas of the phonology. It was found that speakers rely more heavily on transition probabilities between segments of a consonant cluster than between segments of a consonant-vowel sequence. The morphemic integrity of the cluster is also a relevant parameter in predicting the role of probabilistic phonotactics in lexical access, with prefixed items showing a stronger facilitatory effect than pseudoprefixed items. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that phonotactic probabilities are relevant in visual word recognition, and that their effects interact with higher order linguistic information. These findings also enrich our view of the selection-and-competition mechanism that governs written word processing by providing direct evidence of the fact that the speakers anticipate the segment to the right based on implicit knowledge of phonotactic probabilities.},

  abstract = {Development of proficient spoken language skills is disrupted by mutations of the FOXP2 transcription factor. A heterozygous missense mutation in the KE family causes speech apraxia, involving difficulty producing words with complex learned sequences of syllables. Manipulations in songbirds have helped to elucidate the role of this gene in vocal learning, but findings in non-human mammals have been limited or inconclusive. Here we performed a systematic study of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of adult male mice carrying the KE family mutation. Using novel statistical tools, we found that Foxp2 heterozygous mice did not have detectable changes in USV syllable acoustic structure, but produced shorter sequences and did not shift to more complex syntax in social contexts where wildtype animals did. Heterozygous mice also displayed a shift in the position of their rudimentary laryngeal motor cortex layer-5 neurons. Our findings indicate that although mouse USVs are mostly innate, the underlying contributions of FoxP2 to sequencing of vocalizations are conserved with humans.},

  abstract = {A spoken language eye-tracking methodology was used to evaluate the effects of sentence context and proficiency on parallel language activation during spoken language comprehension. Nonnative speakers with varying proficiency levels viewed visual displays while listening to French sentences (e.g., Marie va décrire la poule [Marie will describe the chicken]). Displays depicted several objects including the final noun target (chicken) and an interlingual near-homophone (e.g., pool) whose name in English is phonologically similar to the French target (poule). Listeners’ eye movements reflected temporary consideration of the interlingual competitor when hearing the target noun, demonstrating cross-language lexical competition. However, competitor fixations were dramatically reduced when prior sentence information was incompatible with the competitor (e.g., Marie va nourrir… [Marie will feed…]). In contrast, interlingual competition from English did not vary according to participants’ rated proficiency in French, even though proficiency reliably predicted other aspects of processing behavior, suggesting higher proficiency in the active language does not provide a significant independent source of control over interlingual competition. The results provide new insights into the nature of parallel language activation in naturalistic sentential contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

In this study, we examined the temporal dynamics of humour comprehension between two types of jokes: semantic (SEMs) and pun (PUNs) jokes, using electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques. Thirty SEMs and 30 PUNs were presented to 16 healthy subjects, and their EEG data were concurrently recorded. PUNs consequently showed a larger N400 amplitude than did SEMs, without a specified scalp site, which implies that PUNs induce greater surprise and semantic violation. Meanwhile, SEMs induced a larger P600-like amplitude at the posterior site, which implies that, in order to understand SEMs, higher working memory loads are needed to form novel associations and successfully frame-shift. A possible explanation is the differing logical mechanisms used to understand SEMs and PUNs: the former builds on semantic relationships, the latter on phonological causality.},

Evidence about these significant changes indicated that college students were more prone to feel anxious and depressed. To derive a precise assessment of the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom among college students worldwide, we conducted this meta-analysis. Methods Based on the guidance of PRISMA, literature was searched in Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycArticles (last search November 6, 2020). These articles after the screening were analyzed by a random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom. Also, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were performed in this meta-analysis. Results The results showed that the pooled anxiety symptom prevalence was 31\% (95\% CI: 23-39\%), pooled depressive symptom prevalence was 34\% (95\% CI: 27-41\%). Subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom among different countries’ college students were different, and the pooled depressive symptom prevalence of females was higher compared with males. Limitations The prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom in worldwide college students could be better assessed by a standard and reliable questionnaire. Conclusions The results suggest that the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom during the COVID-19 pandemic is relatively high. Except for interventions that should be taken to control the pandemic urgently, mental health services are also needed to decrease the risk of anxiety and depression among college students.},

  abstract = {We develop an unsupervised algorithm for morphological acquisition to investigate the relationship between linguistic representation, data statistics, and learning algorithms. We model the phenomenon that children acquire the morphological inflections of a language monotonically by introducing an algorithm that uses a bootstrapped, frequency-driven learning procedure to acquire rules monotonically. The algorithm learns a morphological grammar in terms of a Base and Transforms representation, a simple rule-based model of morphology. When tested on corpora of child-directed speech in English from CHILDES (MacWhinney in The CHILDES-Project: Tools for analyzing talk. Erlbaum, Hillsdale, 2000), the algorithm learns the most salient rules of English morphology and the order of acquisition is similar to that of children as observed by Brown (A first language: the early stages. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1973). Investigations of statistical distributions in corpora reveal that the algorithm is able to acquire morphological grammars due to its exploitation of Zipfian distributions in morphology through type-frequency statistics. These investigations suggest that the computation and frequency-driven selection of discrete morphological rules may be important factors in children’s acquisition of basic inflectional morphological systems.},

Conversational and narrative language samples from 47 5-20 yr olds with DS were compared to those from 47 control Ss (aged 2-6 yrs) matched statistically for nonverbal mental age. Results show that Ss with DS have a specific language impairment, compared to control Ss, in number of different words and total words and in mean length of utterance (MLU). Total utterance attempts per minute were more frequent in the DS group. Narrative samples contained more word tokens, more word types, and longer MLU than conversation samples, for both groups.

We used a simple picture-word matching task in which we crossed predictiveness and congruency. Our results indicate a three-way interaction between predictiveness, congruency, and age, in that, younger adults showed an N400 effect only in strongly constrained conditions; whereas, older adults showed an effect in both strongly- and weakly constrained conditions. This interaction was not modulated by language experience or cognitive decline.

  abstract = {Borthen (2010) presents a corpus study of plural personal pronouns in Norwegian, demonstrating that plural pronouns may appear linguistically less ‘well-behaved’ than their singular correspondents, in the sense that the cognitive status encoded by plural pronouns is less restrictive than that encoded by singular pronouns, and hence they tend to have a vague reference. Her study also reveals that the lexically encoded person and/or number features of plural pronouns appear to be incompatible with the interpretation they achieve in context. Based on her study, Borthen claims that there is an asymmetry between plural and singular pronouns. In this paper, we first discuss the special use of the third person plural pronoun they in English, the so-called singular they, and then the special use of the third person singular pronoun ta ‘he/she/it’ in Chinese, providing supportive evidence for Borthen's findings that pronouns are referentially less well-behaved, but counter-evidence against her claim about the asymmetry between plural and singular pronouns.},

In order to explain the observed error patterns in terms of a model of the lexicon, one has to argue in favour of specialized morphological components for the processing of polymorphemic stimuli, an assumption that is also proposed in some models of generative morphology as well as in the psycholinguistic literature. In experimental cognitive neurolinguistics it has been discussed how further developments within the logogen paradigm can explain functional disorders in processing mono- and polymorphemic words in a unified theory. This article presents the results of 4 single case studies with patients (25-, 37-, and 62-yr-old males and a 65-yr-old female) clinically classified as agrammatics who showed dissociations of theoretically distinguishable word formation processes. It is discussed which special form of the morpholexical system has to be postulated to fit the experimental findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Middle school students participating in school-to-home hands-on energy monitoring activities are compared to middle school and high school students in a different project taking part in activities such as an after-school robotics program. Both groups are compared and contrasted with a third group of high school students admitted at the eleventh grade to an academy of mathematics and science. All students were assessed using the same science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) dispositions instrument. Findings indicate that the after-school group whose participants self-selected STEM engagement activities, and the self-selected academy of mathematics and science group, each had highly positive STEM dispositions comparable to those of STEM professionals, while a subset of the middle school whole-classroom energy monitoring group that reported high interest in STEM as a career, also possessed highly positive STEM dispositions comparable to the STEM Professionals group. The authors conclude that several different kinds of hands-on STEM engagement activities are likely to foster or maintain positive STEM dispositions at the middle school and high school levels, and that these highly positive levels of dispositions can be viewed as a target toward which projects seeking to interest mainstream secondary students in STEM majors in college and STEM careers, can hope to aspire. Gender findings regarding STEM dispositions are also reported for these groups.},

The first experiment used a masked priming procedure where the prime was either the first, or the second character of a two-character word. We showed that with semantically compositional ("transparent") words, priming obtained whether the prime was the first or the second constituent. However, when the constituents were not semantically compositional ("opaque"), lexical access was only facilitated when the prime was the first constituent of the word, contradicting the decomposition view. This result was extended in Experiment 2 using a bilingual variation of the same paradigm - the prime was an English word associate of the first or second constituent of a two-character Chinese word. The results also contradicted the predictions of the decomposition hypothesis. In the third experiment, we manipulated cohort size of the first and second constituent, and showed that whereas cohort size modulated access for transparent words, it had no effect for opaque words. The results were explained with a cohort model which hypothesizes that bimorphemic words are represented as a whole. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

Differences in lexical access time for the words were measured with the pronunciation task, and differences in meaning were assessed with the association task. Multiple regression analyses of lexical-decision RT were conducted using associative RT, pronunciation RT, and other target word properties (printed frequency, length, instance dominance, and number of dictionary meanings) as predictor variables. These analyses revealed a relationship between lexical-decision RT and associative RT after the effects of other variables had been partialed out. Word frequency continued to have a significant relationship to lexical-decision RT beyond that shared with pronunciation RT and the other variables. Results indicate that at least some of the effect of word meaning and word frequency in lexical decision is attributable to a decision stage following lexical access.

In contrast, in cases in which the base-rate or the individuating information is lengthy and/or is presented late in the informational sequence, the tendency to use it is greater under ample versus limited resources.

  abstract = {Following much work in linguistic theory, it is hypothesized that the language faculty has a modular structure and consists of two basic components, a lexicon of (structured) entries and a computational system of combinatorial operations to form larger linguistic expressions from lexical entries. This target article provides evidence for the dual nature of the language faculty by describing recent results of a multidisciplinary investigation of German inflection. We have examined: (1) its linguistic representation, focussing on noun plurals and verb inflection (participles), (2) processes involved in the way adults produce and comprehend inflected words, (3) brain potentials generated during the processing of inflected words, and (4) the way children acquire and use inflection. It will be shown that the evidence from all these sources converges and supports the distinction between lexical entries and combinatorial operations.Our experimental results indicate that adults have access to two distinct processing routes, one accessing (irregularly) inflected entries from the mental lexicon and another involving morphological decomposition of (regularly) inflected words into stem+affix representations. These two processing routes correspond to the dual structure of the linguistic system. Results from event-related potentials confirm this linguistic distinction at the level of brain structures. In children's language, we have also found these two processes to be clearly dissociated; regular and irregular inflection are used under different circumstances, and the constraints under which children apply them are identical to those of the adult linguistic system.Our findings will be explained in terms of a linguistic model that maintains the distinction between the lexicon and the computational system but replaces the traditional view of the lexicon as a simple list of idiosyncrasies with the notion of internally structured lexical representations.},

  abstract = {Williams syndrome (WS) is a neuro-developmental disorder which is characterized by an unusual fractionation of language abilities and other cognitive functions. We have investigated four cases of English-speaking subjects with WS, and we show that despite their low IQs the WS children's performance on syntactic tasks and on regular inflection is not impaired. Irregular inflection, however, is affected causing many errors. We also report results from studies investigating the same linguistic phenomena in children with specific language impairment. These children exhibit a different pattern of impairment, with relatively poor performance on syntactic tasks and regular inflection. We suggest a linguistic characterization of the morphosyntax in WS according to which WS subjects are impaired in accessing (particular kinds of) information from lexical entries, with their computational system for language appearing to be intact. We interpret the selective impairments found in WS and SLI as supporting the theoretical distinction between a computational system and an associative memory system for language.},

VEPs were recorded in response to a small circular checkerboard stimulus that was flashed over a range of visual field positions. Temporally and spatially overlapping VEP components were distinguished by differences in retinotopic sensitivity and scalp topography, and by inverse dipole modeling. The C1 component (50-80 ms) was found to change its polarity and topography systematically as a function of stimulus position in a manner consistent with the retinotopic organization of the striate cortex. The P1 component (comprised of the P75 and P100 subcomponents) had a time course that overlapped the C1 but could be distinguished from the C1 by its differing topography and reduced sensitivity to stimulus position. The P1 generators were localized to the lateral extrastriate cortex. Inverse dipole models were consistent with these striate and extrastriate source locations for the C1 and P1, respectively. The N1 component (120-180 ms) was found to originate from several spatially distinct generators that differed in their retinotopic organization. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Without them, they can't exemplify syntactic patterns, morphological structure, or even the sound patterns of their language. Words, in short, offer the primary linguistic means for conveying meaning. English-speaking adults, for example, make use of a production lexicon of anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 wordforms; their comprehension lexicon is even larger. Learning words, then, is a major part of learning language, and it is inextricably linked to the acquisition of syntax, of morphology, and of phonology. By age two, children may be able to produce anywhere from 50 to 500 or 600 words. They add steadily to this stock at a rate estimated at around ten words a day, to reach a vocabulary of some 14,000 by age six. From then on, children average at least 3,000 new words a year through age 17. It has also been estimated that, from about age ten on, schoolchildren are exposed to about 10,000 new words a year; so by age 15, they have been exposed to some 85,000 word roots and as many as 100,000 distinct word meanings in school texts alone.},

And they produce systematic morphological modulations of those words within their first year of talking. As they move to more complex expression of their meanings, they add grammatical morphemes – prefixes, suffixes, prepositions, postpositions, and clitics. On nouns, for example, they start to add morphemes to mark such distinctions as gender, number, and case; on verbs, they add markers for aspect, tense, gender, number, and person. Within a particular language, children's mastery of such paradigms may take several years. There are at least three reasons for this: (a) some meaning distinctions appear to be more complex conceptually than others, and so take longer to learn; (b) some paradigms are less regular than others, and they too take longer to learn; and (c) language typology may affect the process of morphological acquisition: suffixes, for instance, are acquired more readily, and earlier, than prefixes.},

This is a timely and valuable book that explores the complex theoretical associations between language and theory of mind. Theory of mind is broadly defined as the ability to understand others' mental states, for example emotions, beliefs and desires. This book expands the study of theory of mind to look at the role language plays in the development of a child's theory of mind and whether language development is crucial to theory of mind ability. The book is organized into four parts and in total, there are 15 chapters. This is an academic book which presents and discusses the importance of the contributors' research findings in this area. The volume achieves its aims and is well written and edited but it is not a book that will help practitioners to facilitate either language or theory of mind development. This book is a fascinating read and is recommended for those interested in theory of mind, particularly those undertaking undergraduate and post graduate study and/or research in this area.

  abstract = {In an investigation of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform and brain-behavior connections in beginning readers, first grade girls were shown first presentations and immediate repetitions of concrete and abstract known words (e.g., doll, bad), unknown words (e.g., loll ), difficult words (e.g., doubt), and nonwords (e.g., lllo) in list form as ERPs were recorded. Participants were divided into low-ability and high-ability reading groups based on scores on standardized reading tests. High-ability readers had larger N100s to unfamiliar stimuli, implying more attention paid to more difficult stimuli for this group. Alternately, the P200 was larger for low-ability readers, implying more perceptual preprocessing for this group. Low-ability readers also lacked a substantial N400, while high-ability readers evidenced a widely-distributed N400 to all types of stimuli, implying differential postlexical processing between groups. Although the effect of repetition was not significant during the N400 epoch, the ERP repetition effect during the 600-1000 ms epoch was such that repetitions were more positive than first presentations. Across subjects, known and difficult words elicited a repetition effect, while only known words elicited the effect for high-ability readers, and there was no effect for low-ability readers. There was also no concreteness effect for low-ability readers, although abstract and concrete words elicited differential processing in high-ability readers. Overall, the findings suggest that the fledgling word-processing system is more flexible and open to linguistic possibility than the fluent system, and that the N400 can serve as an index of this developmental difference. Moreover, the N400 may serve as an oblique index of the automaticity of lower-level processes that theoretically contribute to the higher-level integration process which the N400 represents.

  abstract = {Both behavioral and electrophysiological evidence suggests that fluent readers decompose morphologically complex words into their constituent parts. Previous event-related potential (ERP) research has been equivocal with regard to whether the N400 component indexes morphological decomposition or the integration of the products of decomposition, a process called semantic composition. In a visual lexical decision task with college students, we recorded ERPs to a well-controlled set of words and nonwords made up of bound morphemes (discern, predict; disject, percern) or free morphemes (cobweb, earring; cobline, bobweb) and monomorphemic control words and nonwords (garlic, minnow; gartus, buzlic). For each of the three morphological types, participants were faster to respond to words than to nonwords. Furthermore, for each of the three morphological types, the amplitude of the N400 was more negative to nonwords than to matched words, an effect indicating that the N400 is more sensitive to the lexicality of the whole stimulus than to the meaningfulness of the constituent parts of the stimulus. The N400 lexicality effect was not significantly different across the three morphological types. To our knowledge, this is the first ERP study to directly compare the processing of printed sets of words composed of bound and free morphemes and monomorphemic control stimuli in order to explore the relative sensitivity of the N400 to morphological decomposition (i.e., the status of the parts) and semantic composition (i.e., the status of the whole). Our findings are consistent with an interpretation of the N400 as an index of a process of semantic composition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

This paper reviews what is known about how multimorphemic words are represented in production at lexical and post-lexical stages as well as the influence that lexical properties have on post-lexical processes. A proposal linking these facts together is presented which predicts that post-lexical processes (1) should be weaker when acting across morpheme bundaries and (2) should be influenced by the lexical properties of each morpheme. Post-lexical processing is thus predicted to vary, or be “heterogeneous”, across a multimorphemic word. Phoneme competition (as indexed by inhibitory effects of phoneme similarity) is compared within and across morphemes in three analyses of oral reading latencies. Competition is found to be weaker across morpheme boundaries, providing support for heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Is there specialization for visual word recognition within the visual ventral stream of literate human adults? We review the evidence for a specialized “visual word form area” and critically examine some of the arguments recently placed against this hypothesis. Three distinct forms of specialization must be distinguished: functional specialization, reproducible localization, and regional selectivity. Examination of the literature with this theoretical division in mind indicates that reading activates a precise subpart of the left ventral occipitotemporal sulcus, and that patients with pure alexia consistently exhibit lesions of this region (reproducible localization). Second, this region implements processes adequate for reading in a specific script, such as invariance across upper- and lower-case letters, and its lesion results in the selective loss of reading-specific processes (functional specialization). Third, the issue of regional selectivity, namely, the existence of putative cortical patches dedicated to letter and word recognition, cannot be resolved by positron emission tomography or lesion data, but requires high-resolution neuroimaging techniques. The available evidence from single-subject fMRI and intracranial recordings suggests that some cortical sites respond preferentially to letter strings than to other categories of visual stimuli such as faces or objects, though the preference is often relative rather than absolute. We conclude that learning to read results in the progressive development of an inferotemporal region increasingly responsive to visual words, which is aptly named the visual word form area (VWFA).},

  abstract = {A standard model of word reading postulates that visual information is initially processed by occipitotemporal areas contralateral to the stimulated hemifield, from whence it is subsequently transferred to the visual word form (VWF) system, a left inferior temporal region specifically devoted to the processing of letter strings. For stimuli displayed in the left visual field, this transfer proceeds from the right to the left hemisphere through the posterior portion of the corpus callosum. In order to characterize the spatial and temporal organization of these processes, reading tasks with split-field presentation were performed by five control subjects and by two patients suffering from left hemialexia following posterior callosal lesions. The subjects' responses were studied using behavioural measures and functional brain imaging techniques, providing both high spatial resolution (functional MRI, fMRI) and high temporal resolution (high-density event-related potentials, ERPs). Early visual processing was revealed as activations contralateral to stimulation, located by fMRI in the inferior occipitotemporal region and presumably coincident with area V4. A negative wave occurring 150–160 ms post-stimulus, also strictly contralateral to stimulation, was recorded over posterior electrodes. In contrast with these hemifield-dependent effects, the VWF system was revealed as a strictly left-hemispheric activation which, in control subjects, was identical for stimuli presented in the left or in the right hemifield and was located in the middle portion of the left fusiform gyrus. The electrical signature of the VWF system consisted of a unilateral sharp negativity, recorded 180–200 ms post-stimulus over left inferior temporal electrodes. In callosal patients, due to the inability of visual information to pass across the posterior part of the corpus callosum, the VWF system was activated only by stimuli presented in the right visual field. Similarly, a significant influence of the word/non-word status on ERPs recorded over the left hemisphere was discernible for either hemifield in controls, while it affected only right-hemifield stimuli in callosal patients. These findings provide direct support for the main components of the classical model of reading and help specify their timing and cerebral substrates.},

In Experiment 1, RTs to affixed derived words of medium and low surface frequency were studied as a function of their cumulative root frequency. Results show that cumulative root frequency determines the latencies to suffixed words but not to prefixed words. In Experiment 2, it was shown that RTs to derived suffixed words belonging to the same morphological family (i.e., words sharing a same root) vary as a function of their relative whole word frequency. The asymmetry in the role of cumulative root frequency for prefixed and suffixed words is interpreted with reference to the different sequential morphological organization of these two types of words (Affix + Root) versus (Root + Affix). It is proposed that only suffixed words are accessed via the root. In the recognition of these words access to the root implies access to the corresponding morphological family. The members of the family are then examined in a frequency-ordered search.},

The experiments were based on the assumption that 2 orthographically similar words, separated by a short stimulus onset asynchrony, both belong to the same activated set and are therefore competing for recognition. In Exp I, the lexical status of the target was varied, and an inhibitory effect was also found only when targets are words, not when they are pseudowords. An inhibitory effect was also found in Exps II and III for target words of high frequency, whereas with low-frequency target words, either a nonsignificant inhibitory effect or a facilitatory effect was found. Moreover, the effect seemed to vary in relation to the position of the letters shared by prime and target. Results are discussed in terms of an explanation according to which the prime would inhibit the word units of the activated set when these units reach a critical threshold of activation. This threshold would be reached faster by high-frequency words of the set because they start from a higher resting level. An alternative explanation consistent with the verification model is taken into account. (20 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Moreover, verbs tend to be more abstract than nouns, and this aspect might make verb processing more difficult. Finally, the developmental gap in the production of nouns and verbs suggests that age of acquisition might affect noun and verbs differently. Nouns and verbs were presented in a lexical decision and in a naming task. The morphological variable root frequency in addition to word frequency, length and word age of acquisition, and the semantic variables concreteness and context availability (P. J. Schwanenflugel, K. K. K. Harnishfeger, and R. W. Stowe, 1988) were used as predictors in multiple-regression analyses in which lexical decision and naming latencies were the dependent variables. The results showed that age of acquisition, context availability, and root frequency are all important in predicting both lexical decision and naming latencies for nouns and verbs, but age of acquisition and root frequency are better predictors of the differences in processing Italian nouns and verbs.

The DRC is a computational realization of the dual-route theory of reading, and is the only computational model of reading that can perform the 2 tasks most commonly used to study reading: lexical decision and reading aloud. For both tasks, the authors show that a wide variety of variables that influence human latencies influence the DRC model's latencies in exactly the same way. The DRC model simulates a number of such effects that other computational models of reading do not, but there appear to be no effects that any other current computational model of reading can simulate but that the DRC model cannot. The authors conclude that the DRC model is the most successful of the existing computational models of reading.},

Their model has but a single route from print to speech, yet, they contend, it can account for major facts about reading that have hitherto been claimed to require a dual-route architecture. The authors identify 6 of these major facts about reading. The 1-route model proposed by Seidenberg and McClelland can account for the 1st of these but not the remaining 5. Because models with dual-route architectures can explain all 6 of these basic facts about reading, the authors suggest that this remains the viable architecture for any tenable model of skilled reading and learning to read.

Using the letter detection task in Experiment 1, we compared letter pairs that could be considered as a grapheme unit or not depending on context (referred to as weakly cohesive complex, e.g., an in chant vs cane) to real two-letter graphemes (highly cohesive complex, e.g., au in chaud) and single-letter graphemes (simple, e.g., a in place). Three experimental conditions were used, one of which was designed to prevent phonological influences. Data revealed that only highly cohesive complex graphemes were processed as units, not the weakly cohesive ones. The same pattern was found across experimental conditions in favor of an orthographic mechanism. In Experiments 2 and 3, a primed lexical decision task was used with two stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) and two different ranges of lexical frequency. We manipulated the number of graphemes removed from partial primes (d**che vs do**he-DOUCHE) and relatedness. In contrast to Experiment 1, no evidence was provided in favor of a role of graphemes during lexical access. We suggest that graphemes can be conceived as sub-lexical orthographic units per se but can only be captured within a sub-lexical route to reading.},

The independence of this response (the phonological mismatch negativity, PMN) from the ERP component known to be sensitive to semantic violations (N400) was demonstrated by manipulating sentence endings so that phonemic and semantic violations occurred together or separately. Four conditions used sentences that ended with (1) the highest Cloze probability word (e.g., “The piano was out of tune.”), (2) a word having the same initial phoneme of the highest Cloze probability word but that was, in fact, semantically anomalous (e.g., “The gambler had a streak of bad luggage.”), (3) a word having an initial phoneme different from that of the highest Cloze probability word but that was, in fact, semantically appropriate (e.g., “Don caught the ball with his glove.”), or (4) a word that was semantically anomalous and, therefore, had an initial phoneme that was totally unexpected given the sentence's context (e.g., “The dog chased our cat up the queen”). Neither the PMN nor the N400 was found in the first condition. Only an N400 was observed in the second condition while only a PMN was seen in the third. Both responses were elicited in the last condition. Finally, a delayed N400 occurred to semantic violations in the second condition where the initial phoneme was identical to that of the highest Cloze probability ending.

  abstract = {Two-dimensional maps of individual layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the macaque monkey were constructed and used as a basis for comparing laminar size, shape, and topographic organization. Topographical data from the electrophysiological investigation of the LGN by Malpeli and Baker ('75) were displayed on maps of all six layers. As known from previous studies, there is a significant over-representation of central vision in the LGN. Unexpectedly, though, the visual representation is anisotropic over portions of most LGN layers. That is, the linear magnification factor (millimeters along the laminar surface per degree of visual field) is not equal for all directions from a given point in the visual field. Moreover, the visual representations in the parvicellular and magnocellular divisions of the LGN differ both in their emphasis on central vision and in their anisotropies. To determine the degree of individual variability, laminar maps were prepared from the LGN of seven other hemispheres. The shapes of laminar maps varied considerably between LGNs, from nearly circular to highly elliptical, but the surface area was relatively constant for each layer. Topographical organization, determined by mapping the optic disc representation on the LGN laminae and by labeling from anterograde and retrograde tracer injections in striate cortex, showed significant individual variability. Interestingly, the visual representations in the LGN and striate cortex are topologically inverted with respect to one another. This indicates that the establishment of geniculocortical connections involves a systematic crossing-over of fibers. Information on cell densities and magnification factors in striate cortex obtained from other studies was compared to the results of the present study in order to estimate ratios of cortical neurons to LGN neurons at different eccentricities. The total number of cortical neurons per LGN neuron is about 130 on average, but it extends over approximately a tenfold range, from less than 100 in the far periphery to nearly 1,000 in the fovea. The estimated number of cells in layers 4A and 4Cβ per parvicellular layer neuron is smaller and extends over a slightly narrower range, from 30 to 240, whereas the number of layer 4Cα neurons per magnocellular neuron varies more widely, from about 45 to 7,000.},

  abstract = {In order to investigate whether syllable frequency effects in visual word recognition can be attributed to phonologically or orthographically defined syllables, we designed one experiment that allowed six critical comparisons. Whereas only a weak effect was obtained when both orthographic and phonological syllable frequency were conjointly manipulated in Comparison 1, robust effects for phonological and null effects for orthographic syllable frequency were found in Comparisons 2 and 3. Comparisons 4 and 5 showed that the syllable frequency effect does not result from a confound with the frequency of letter or phoneme clusters at the beginning of words. The syllable frequency effect was shown to diminish with increasing word frequency in Comparison 6. These results suggest that visually presented polysyllabic words are parsed into phonologically defined syllables during visual word recognition.

  abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been increasing evidence for syllabic processing during visual word recognition. If syllabic effects prove to be independent from orthographic redundancy, this would seriously challenge the ability of current computational models to account for the processing of polysyllabic words. Three experiments are presented to disentangle effects of the frequency of syllabic units and orthographic segments in lexical decision. In Experiment 1 the authors obtained an inhibitory syllable frequency effect that was unaffected by the presence or absence of a bigram trough at the syllable boundary. In Experiments 2 and 3 an inhibitory effect of initial syllable frequency but a facilitative effect of initial bigram frequency emerged when manipulating 1 of the 2 measures and controlling for the other in Spanish words starting with consonant-vowel syllables. The authors conclude that effects of syllable frequency and letter-cluster frequency are independent and arise at different processing levels of visual word recognition. Results are discussed within the framework of an interactive activation model of visual word recognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

However, little is known about how these visual social cues are integrated over time in the brain and, notably, whether this binding occurs in the emotional or the motor system. By coupling magnetic resonance and electroencephalography imaging in humans, we were able to show that, 200 ms after stimulus onset, the premotor cortex integrated gaze, gesture, and emotion displayed by a congener. At earlier stages, emotional content was processed independently in the amygdala (170 ms), whereas directional cues (gaze direction with pointing gesture) were combined at ∼190 ms in the parietal and supplementary motor cortices. These results demonstrate that the early binding of visual social signals displayed by an agent engaged the dorsal pathway and the premotor cortex, possibly to facilitate the preparation of an adaptive response to another person's immediate intention.},

  abstract = {Fundamental learning abilities related to the implicit encoding of sequential structure have been postulated to underlie language acquisition and processing. However, there is very little direct evidence to date supporting such a link between implicit statistical learning and language. In three experiments using novel methods of assessing implicit learning and language abilities, we show that sensitivity to sequential structure – as measured by improvements to immediate memory span for structurally-consistent input sequences – is significantly correlated with the ability to use knowledge of word predictability to aid speech perception under degraded listening conditions. Importantly, the association remained even after controlling for participant performance on other cognitive tasks, including short-term and working memory, intelligence, attention and inhibition, and vocabulary knowledge. Thus, the evidence suggests that implicit learning abilities are essential for acquiring long-term knowledge of the sequential structure of language – i.e., knowledge of word predictability – and that individual differences on such abilities impact speech perception in everyday situations. These findings provide a new theoretical rationale linking basic learning phenomena to specific aspects of spoken language processing in adults, and may furthermore indicate new fruitful directions for investigating both typical and atypical language development.},

Here we explored whether such modality constraints also affect implicit statistical learning in an artificial grammar learning task. Participants were exposed to statistically governed input sequences and then tested on their ability to classify novel items. We explored three types of presentation formats—visual input distributed spatially, visual input distributed temporally, auditory input distributed temporally—and two rates of presentation: moderate (4 elements/second) and fast (8 elements/second). Overall, learning abilities were best for visual-spatial and auditory input. Additionally, at the faster presentation rate, performance declined only for the visual-temporal condition. Finally, auditory learning was mediated by increased sensitivity to the endings of input sequences, whereas vision was most sensitive to the beginnings of sequences. These results suggest that statistical learning for sequential and spatial patterns proceeds differently across the visual and auditory modalities.},

In addition, performance for the reasoning task was compared to predictions made by mental model theory and the probability heuristics model. According to mental model theory, syllogisms that require the use of more mental models are more difficult. According to the probability heuristics model difficulty is related to the number of probabilistic heuristics that must be applied, or (for invalid syllogisms) inconsistencies between the derived and correct conclusion. The predictions of these theories were examined across two experiments. In general, people with larger working memory capacities reasoned better. Also, the responses made by people with larger capacities were more likely to correspond to the predictions made by both mental model theory and the probability heuristics model. Relations between working memory span and performance were also consistent with both theories.},

  abstract = {Much like sentences are composed of words, words themselves are composed of smaller units. For example, the English word questionably can be analyzed as question+able+ly. However, this structural decomposition of the word does not directly give us a semantic representation of the word's meaning. Since morphology obeys the principle of compositionality, the semantics of the word can be systematically derived from the meaning of its parts. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic model of word formation that captures both the analysis of a word w into its constituents segments and the synthesis of the meaning of w from the meanings of those segments. Our model jointly learns to segment words into morphemes and compose distributional semantic vectors of those morphemes. We experiment with the model on English CELEX data and German DerivBase (Zeller et al., 2013) data. We show that jointly modeling semantics increases both segmentation accuracy and morpheme F1 by between 3\% and 5\%. Additionally, we investigate different models of vector composition, showing that recurrent neural networks yield an improvement over simple additive models. Finally, we study the degree to which the representations correspond to a linguist's notion of morphological productivity.},

We evaluate the role of the similarity structure of the target forms (the adult vocabulary) and the similarity structure of the input forms (the semantic structure) on the evolution of the network's vocabulary. The model's performance offers a principled account of various phenomena associated with children's early vocabulary development including the difficulty of acquiring synonyms, the appearance of idiosyncratic forms and over-extension errors. The model makes several unexplored predictions for the developmental profiles of young children acquiring morphology.},

The sensitivity of each hemisphere to the different meanings evoked by the pun was assessed by ERP relatedness effects with presentation to the LVF and the RVF. In Experiment 1, the inter-stimulus interval between the pun and the onset of the visual probe was 0 ms; in Experiment 2, this value was 500ms. In Experiment 1, both highly and moderately related probes elicited similar priming effects with RVF presentation. Relative to their unrelated counterparts, related probes elicited less negative ERPs in the N400 interval (300–600ms post-onset), and more positive ERPs 600–900ms post-onset, suggesting both meanings of the pun were equally active in the left hemisphere. LVF presentation yielded similar priming effects (less negative N400 and a larger positivity thereafter) for the highly related probes, but no effects for moderately related probes. In Experiment 2, similar N400 priming effects were observed for highly and moderately related probes presented to both visual fields. Compared to unrelated probes 600–900ms post-onset, related probes elicited a centro-parietal positivity with RVF presentation, but a fronto-polar positivity with LVF presentation. Results suggest that initially, the different meanings evoked by a pun are both active in the left hemisphere, but only the most highly related meaning is active in the right hemisphere.

It was found that the simples and the counted 4s evoked posteriorly distributed P3 waves (latency 380–430 msec) while the irrelevant novels evoked large, frontally distributed P3 waves (latency 360–380 msec). These large, frontal P3 waves to novels were also found to be preceded by large N2 waves (latency 278 msec). These findings indicate that “the P3” wave is not a unitary phenomenon but should be considered in terms of a family of waves, differing in their brain generators and in their psychological correlates.

In the 2 studies described here, we focus first on how the complexity of morphological affixation in CDS relates to the particular language the maternal caregivers are speaking, and second on how these properties of CDS are reflected in the morphological complexity of the children's language. Ss in Study 1 were 4 White mothers, 3 Inuit mothers, and one grandmother who lived with a younger mother; their children were aged 1.6–2.1 yrs old.

  abstract = {Recent masked priming experiments have brought to light a morphological level of analysis that is exclusively based on the orthographic appearance of words, so that it breaks down corner into corn- and -er, as well as dealer into deal- and -er (Rastle, Davis, \& New, 2004). Being insensitive to semantic factors, this morpho-orthographic segmentation process cannot capture the morphological relationship between irregularly inflected words and their base forms (e.g., fell‚Äìfall, bought‚Äìbuy); hence, the prediction follows that these words should not facilitate each other in masked priming experiments. However, the first experiment described in the present work demonstrates that fell does facilitate fall more than orthographically matched (e.g., fill) and unrelated control words (e.g., hope). Experiments 2 and 3 also show that this effect cannot be explained through orthographic sub-regularities that characterize many irregular inflections, as no priming arose when unrelated words showing the same orthographic patterns were tested (e.g., tell‚Äìtall vs. toll‚Äìtall). These results highlight the existence of a second higher-level source of masked morphological priming; we propose that this second source of priming is located at the lemma level, where inflected words (but not derived words) share their representation irrespective of orthographic regularity.

  abstract = {Although masked stem priming (e.g., dealer–DEAL) is one of the most established effects in visual word identification, it is less clear whether primes and targets sharing a suffix (e.g., kindness–WILDNESS) also yield facilitation. In a new take on this issue, we show that prime nonwords facilitate lexical decisions to target words ending with the same suffix (sheeter–TEACHER) compared to a condition where the critical suffix was substituted by another one (sheetal–TEACHER) or by an unrelated nonmorphological ending (sheetub– TEACHER). We also show that this effect is genuinely morphological, as no priming emerged in noncomplex items with the same orthographic characteristics (sportel–BROTHEL vs. sportic–BROTHEL vs. sportur–BROTHEL). In a further experiment, we took advantage of these results to assess whether suffixes are recognized in a position-specific fashion. Masked suffix priming did not emerge when the relative order of stems and suffixes was reversed in the prime nonwords—ersheet did not yield any time saving in the identification of teacher as compared to either alsheet or obsheet. We take these results to show that –er was not identified as a morpheme in ersheet, thus indicating that suffix identification is position specific. This conclusion is in line with data on interference effects in nonword rejection and strongly constrains theoretical proposals on how complex words are identified. In particular, because these findings were reported in a masked priming paradigm, they suggest that positional constraints operate early, most likely at a prelexical level of morpho-orthographic analysis.},

Experiments 1 and 2 suggest this to be the case, as they show that morphological priming crosses grammatical class boundaries in overt paradigm conditions. Experiment 3 shows that, in masked priming conditions, cross-class facilitation emerges both for genuine derivations and pseudo-related pairs with a homographic stem (e.g., port-e, doors, and port-are, to carry), which is taken to suggest that grammatical class–free stem representations are located at a pre-lexical level of morphological processing.

  abstract = {There is broad consensus that printed complex words are identified on the basis of their constituent morphemes. This fact raises the issue of how the word identification system codes for morpheme position, hence allowing it to distinguish between words like overhang and hangover, and to recognize that preheat is a word, whereas heatpre is not. Recent data have shown that suffixes are identified as morphemes only when they occur at the end of letter strings (Crepaldi, Rastle, \& Davis, 2010, “Morphemes in Their Place: Evidence for Position-Specific Identification of Suffixes,” Memory \& Cognition, 38, 312–321), which supports the general proposal that the word identification system is sensitive to morpheme positional constraints. This proposal leads to the prediction that the identification of free stems should occur in a position-independent fashion, given that free stems can occur anywhere within complex words (e.g., overdress and dresser). In Experiment 1, we show that the rejection time of transposed-constituent pseudocompounds (e.g., moonhoney) is longer than that of matched control nonwords (e.g., moonbasin), suggesting that honey and moon are identified within moonhoney, and that these morpheme representations activate the representation for the word honeymoon. In Experiments 2 and 3, we demonstrate that the masked presentation of transposed-constituent pseudocompounds (e.g., moonhoney) facilitates the identification of compound words (honeymoon). In contrast, monomorphemic control pairs do not produce a similar pattern (i.e., rickmave did not prime maverick), indicating that the effect for moonhoney pairs is genuinely morphological in nature. These results demonstrate that stem representations differ from affix representations in terms of their positional constraints, providing a challenge to all existing theories of morphological processing.

Here, we propose a novel automatic pipeline (APP) for pre-processing and artifact rejection of EEG data, which innovates relative to existing methods by not only following state-of-the-art guidelines but also further employing robust statistics. Methods APP was tested on event-related potential (ERP) data from healthy participants and schizophrenia patients, and resting-state (RS) data from healthy participants. Its performance was compared with that of existing automatic methods (FASTER for ERP data, TAPEEG and Prep pipeline for RS data) and supervised pre-processing by experts. Results APP rejected fewer bad channels and bad epochs than the other methods. In the ERP study, it produced significantly higher amplitudes than FASTER, which were consistent with the supervised scheme. In the RS study, it produced spectral measures that correlated well with the automatic alternatives and the supervised scheme. Conclusion APP effectively removed EEG artifacts, performing similarly to the supervised scheme and outperforming existing automatic alternatives.

In one condition, background, target, and deviant stimuli were simple geometric figures. In a second condition, all stimulus types were unfamiliar/unusual figures. In a third condition, background and target stimuli were unusual figures and deviant stimuli were simple shapes. Unusual figures, whether they were deviant, target, or background stimuli, evoked larger N2 responses than their simple, familiar counterparts. N2 elicited by an unusual background stimulus was larger than that evoked by simple, deviant stimuli, a pattern opposite that exhibited by the subsequent P3. Deviance from immediate context had limited influence over N2 amplitude. The results suggest that novelty N2 and novelty P3 reflect the processing of different aspects of 'novel' visual stimuli. The novelty P3 is particularly sensitive to deviation from immediate context. In contrast, the novelty N2 is sensitive to deviation from long-term context that renders a stimulus unfamiliar and difficult to encode.

Event-related potentials were recorded from well-matched frontal patients, parietal patients, and non-brain-injured subjects who controlled their viewing duration (by button press) of line drawings that included a frequent, repetitive background stimulus, an infrequent target stimulus, and infrequent, novel visual stimuli. Damage to the frontal cortex resulted in a much greater disruption of response to novel stimuli than to designated targets. Frontal patients exhibited a widely distributed, profound reduction of the novelty P3 response and a marked diminution of the viewing duration of novel events. In contrast, damage to posterior parietal lobes was associated with a substantial reduction of both target P3 and novelty P3 amplitude; however, there was less disruption of the processing of novel than of target stimuli. We conclude that two nodes of the neuroanatomical network for responding to and processing novelty are the prefrontal and posterior parietal regions, which participate in the voluntary allocation of attention to novel events.

Each of the 3 experimental conditions included a frequent repetitive background stimulus and infrequent stimuli that deviated from the background stimulus. Deviant stimuli elicited larger N2-P3 amplitudes and longer viewing durations than the repetitive background stimulus, even when the deviant stimuli were simple, familiar shapes and the background stimulus was a highly unusual figure. Compared with simple, familiar deviant stimuli, unusual deviant stimuli elicited larger N2-P3 amplitudes and longer viewing times. Within Ss, the deviant stimuli that evoked the largest N2-P3 responses also elicited the longest viewing durations. Deviance from both immediate context and long-term prior experience contributes to the response to novelty, with the combination generating the largest N2-P3 amplitude and the most sustained attention. The amplitude of the N2-P3 may reflect how much "uncertainty" is evoked by a novel visual stimulus and signal the need for further exploration.

The authors investigated the mechanisms underlying these changes by studying the novelty P3 response that measures shifts of attention toward novel events. While event-related potentials were recorded, 10 mildly impaired AD patients and 20 matched normal controls (NC) viewed line drawings that included a repetitive background stimulus, an infrequent target stimulus, and infrequent novel stimuli. Results showed that P3 amplitude to novel stimuli was significantly smaller for AD patients than NC. For NC, P3 response to novel stimuli was much larger than to background stimuli. Although NC spent more time looking at novel than background stimuli, patients with AD distributed their viewing time evenly. Remarkably, for patients with AD, the amplitude of the novelty P3 response powerfully predicted how long they would spend looking at novel stimuli and inversely correlated with apathy severity. The novelty P3 response is markedly diminished in mild AD, at a time when the target P3 response is preserved. The disruption of the novelty P3 response predicts diminished attention to novel stimuli and is associated with the apathy exhibited by patients with AD.

  abstract = {Near-threshold masked semantic priming of lexical decisions is examined under prime presentation conditions established with several different judgment tasks, using a variety of converging indicators to determine whether subjects can introspect on the prime. In the apparent absence of such awareness, priming effects are found to vary nonmonotonically with stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between prime and mask. Priming initially decreases as SOA is shortened in the threshold region, but increases as SOA is shortened further. This phenomenon may help to account for discrepancies between studies in which prime presentation conditions were established with different judgment tasks. In addition, priming is influenced by the type of prime information required for successful performance in the judgment task. Facilitation results from related primes relative to unrelated primes after prime presentation conditions have been established with either detection judgments or word discrimination judgments. However, after semantic similarity judgments, related primes produce inhibition. The implication is that different judgment tasks induce different strategies for retrieving information from perceptual encoding mechanisms. These strategies carry over into the priming task, where they influence the operation of encoding mechanisms even when the strategies fail and prime inputs remain unavailable to introspection.},

  abstract = {An important challenge in the design and analysis of event‐related or single‐trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments is to optimize statistical efficiency, i.e., the accuracy with which the event‐related hemodynamic response to different stimuli can be estimated for a given amount of imaging time. Several studies have suggested that using a fixed inter‐stimulus‐interval (ISI) of at least 15 sec results in optimal statistical efficiency or power and that using shorter ISIs results in a severe loss of power. In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ISIs as short as 500 ms while still maintaining considerable efficiency or power. Here, we attempt to resolve this apparent contradiction by a quantitative analysis of the relative efficiency afforded by different event‐related experimental designs. This analysis shows that statistical efficiency falls off dramatically as the ISI gets sufficiently short, if the ISI is kept fixed for all trials. However, if the ISI is properly jittered or randomized from trial to trial, the efficiency improves monotonically with decreasing mean ISI. Importantly, the efficiency afforded by such variable ISI designs can be more than 10 times greater than that which can be achieved by fixed ISI designs. These results further demonstrate the feasibility of using identical experimental designs with fMRI and electro‐/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) without sacrificing statistical power or efficiency of either technique, thereby facilitating comparison and integration across imaging modalities.

The purpose of this review is: (1) to provide a general overview of the primary models and theories of SL, (2) to describe the empirical research – with a focus on the event-related potential (ERP) literature – in support of these models while also highlighting the current limitations of this research, and (3) to present a set of new lines of ERP research to overcome these limitations. The review is articulated around three descriptive dimensions in relation to SL: the level of abstractness of the representations learned through SL, the effect of the level of attention and consciousness on SL, and the developmental trajectory of SL across the life-span. We conclude with a new tentative model that takes into account these three dimensions and also point to several promising new lines of SL research.},

We investigated whether there are associations between event-related potential (ERP) correlates of SL and language abilities while controlling for the general level of selective attention. Seventeen adults completed tests of visual SL, receptive vocabulary, grammatical ability, and sentence completion. Response times and ERPs showed that SL is related to receptive vocabulary and grammatical ability. ERPs indicated that the relationship between SL and grammatical ability was independent of attention while the association between SL and receptive vocabulary depended on attention. The implications of these dissociative relationships in terms of underlying mechanisms of SL and language are discussed.

Repeated measures multiple regression analyses revealed a P200 effect in the high-frequency range; also the P200 was larger on words at the beginning and end of sentences than on words in the middle of sentences (i.e., a quadratic effect of word position). Predictability strongly affected the N400 component; the effect was stronger for low than for high-frequency words. The P200 frequency effect indicates that high-frequency words are lexically accessed very fast, independent of context information. Effects on the N400 suggest that predictability strongly moderates the late access especially of low-frequency words. Thus, contextual facilitation on the N400 appears to reflect both lexical and post-lexical stages of word recognition, questioning a strict classification into lexical and post-lexical processes.},

We assume that some intermediate level of coding exists between individual letters and whole words, and that this involves the representation of letter combinations. We then investigate the nature of this intermediate level of coding given the constraints of optimality. This intermediate level of coding is expected to compress data while retaining as much information as possible about word identity. Information conveyed by letters is a function of how much they constrain word identity and how visible they are. Optimization of this coding is a combination of minimizing resources (using the most compact representations) and maximizing information. We show that in a large proportion of cases, non-contiguous letter sequences contain more information than contiguous sequences, while at the same time requiring less precise coding. Moreover, we found that the best predictor of human performance in orthographic priming experiments was within-word ranking of conditional probabilities, rather than average conditional probabilities. We conclude that from an optimality perspective, readers learn to select certain contiguous and non-contiguous letter combinations as information that provides the best cue to word identity.},

Irrespective of whether colour categories are taken to be universal (Berlin \& Kay, 1969) or language induced (Davidoff, Davies, \& Roberson, 1999), it is widely assumed that colour boundaries, and hence categorical similarity, would be used when categorising colours. However, we argue that categorical similarity is more reliably used in implicit than in explicit categorisation. Thus, in Experiment 1, we found that category boundaries may be overridden in the explicit task of matching-to-sample: There was a similar strong tendency to ignore colour boundaries and to divide the range of coloured stimuli into two equal groups in both Westerners and in a remote population (Himba). In Experiment 2, we showed that a distinctive stimulus (focal colour) in the range affected the equal division in a matching-to-sample task. Experiment 3 tested the stability of a category boundary in an implicit task (visual search) that assessed categorical perception; only for this task was categorisation largely immune to range effects and largely based on categorical similarity. It is concluded that, even after colour categories are acquired, perceptual rather than categorical similarity is commonly used in judgements of colour similarity.

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a convergence in lesion and neuroimaging data in the identification of circuits underlying positive and negative emotion in the human brain. Emphasis is placed on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala as two key components of this circuitry. Emotion guides action and organizes behavior towards salient goals. To accomplish this, it is essential that the organism have a means of representing affect in the absence of immediate elicitors. It is proposed that the PFC plays a crucial role in affective working memory. The ventromedial sector of the PFC is most directly involved in the representation of elementary positive and negative emotional states while the dorsolateral PFC may be involved in the representation of the goal states towards which these elementary positive and negative states are directed. The amygdala has been consistently identified as playing a crucial role in both the perception of emotional cues and the production of emotional responses, with some evidence suggesting that it is particularly involved with fear-related negative affect. Individual differences in amygdala activation are implicated in dispositional affective styles and increased reactivity to negative incentives. The ventral striatum, anterior cingulate and insular cortex also provide unique contributions to emotional processing.},

The most striking feature of the results, inconsistent with linguistic relativity theory, was the similarity in the patterns of choice of the 3 samples. However, there were also significant differences among the samples. Setswana speakers (who have 1 basic term for BLUE or GREEN) were more likely to group BLUE colors with GREEN colors than either English or Russian speakers. But Russian speakers (who have 2 basic color terms for BLUE) were no more likely than English speakers to group light and dark BLUE separately. In addition Ss differed in the level of consensus in grouping, the number of groups formed, and in the distribution of the number of colors placed in a group. These structural differences may reflect differences in the availability and salience of the color categories across the languages. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants sorted a representative set of 65 colors into N groups (where N ranged from 2 to 12) based on their perceptual similarity. We assessed the similarities and differences among the choices of the 3 language samples, and focused in particular on 2 more specific questions. First, we tested the conjecture that levels of consensus over which tiles to group together should peak when N equalled the number of basic color terms in the language. Second, we focused on possible linguistic influences on color grouping in the GREEN-BLUE region of color space. Setswana uses a single term for this region, whereas English uses 2 terms and Russian uses 3 terms. The most striking feature of the results was the marked similarity of the groups chosen across the 3 language samples. In addition there were small but reliable differences in grouping associated with linguistic differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Experiment 1, we used an illusory word paradigm and found that neighbor-once-removed similarity contexts resulted in fewer illusory word reports than substitution neighbors but more illusory words than double-substitution neighbors. In Experiments 2 and 3, we used a masked form priming technique with a lexical-decision task. The pattern of facilitation was as predicted by spatial coding but was incompatible with slot-coding, Wickelcoding, and both versions of open-bigram coding.

We explored the neural systems involved in processing different word classes in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging study, contrasting four groups of words co-varying morphological complexity (simple, monomorphemic words vs complex derived or inflected words) and syntactic class (verbs vs nouns/adjectives). Subtraction of word from letter string processing showed activation in left frontal and temporal lobe regions consistent with prior studies of visual word processing. No differences were observed for morphologically complex and simple words, despite adequate power to detect stimulus specific effects. A region of posterior left middle temporal gyrus showed significantly increased activation for verbs. Post hoc analyses showed that this elevated activation could also be related to semantic properties of the stimulus items (verbs have stronger action associations...

The spatial coding model described here adopts a different approach to letter position coding and lexical matching based on context-independent letter representations. In this model, letter position is coded dynamically, with a scheme called spatial coding. Lexical matching is achieved via a method called superposition matching, in which input codes and learned codes are matched on the basis of the relative positions of their common letters. Simulations of the model illustrate its ability to explain a broad range of results from the masked form priming literature, as well as to capture benchmark findings from the unprimed lexical decision task.},

This 4-year longitudinal study (Grades 2–5) compared these two factors in three aspects of reading development: pseudoword reading, reading comprehension, and single word reading. Morphological awareness contributed significantly to pseudoword reading and reading comprehension, after controlling prior measures of reading ability, verbal and nonverbal intelligence, and phonological awareness. This contribution was comparable to that of phonological awareness and remained 3 years after morphological awareness was assessed. In contrast, morphological awareness rarely contributed significantly to single word reading. We argue that these results provide evidence that morphological awareness has a wide-ranging role in reading development, one that extends beyond phonological awareness.},

  abstract = {The first point of evidence opposing rule-based learning is the disconnect between the idea of children's initial and exclusive reliance on a phonetic rule in spelling and the growing amount of evidence showing that children young enough to be in this stage demonstrate sensitivity to morphological regularities in their spelling. This is the case for the 5- and 6-year-olds in Treiman and Cassar's (1996) study, and the 6-year-olds in Deacon and [Bryant]'s (2006) study. (Such a concern also exists in relation to the early findings of sensitivity to graphotactic regularities; e.g., [Pacton] et al., 2001). Certainly, some of these discrepancies can be accounted for by the context of assessment. For example, there is some evidence that increasing task demands (e.g., introducing a secondary task or varying the quantity spelt) increases agreement errors for French spellers (e.g., Hupet, Fayol, \& Schelstraete, 1998). For English, a similar pattern emerges based on the metric of analysis. The spelling tund (instead of tuned) is categorized as a phonetic spelling not influenced by morphology by [Nunes] et al. (1997b) who focused on the correct use of -ed, but [Treiman] and Cassar ( 1996) considered such a spelling as influenced by morphology if /n/ was transcribed accurately more often in two- than in one-morpheme words (e.g., tuned vs. brand). More important, not all findings can be discounted on this basis. Deacon and Bryant (2005; 2006) recently demonstrated that young children demonstrate an appreciation of the relationship between morphemes and spelling even though the coding required correct spellings of whole morphemes and not just single letters (see also Deacon, 2008). Young children's appreciation of the role of morphemes in spelling goes directly against the predictions made for Nunes et al.'s stage of initially phonetic spelling. Nous présentons notre point de vue sur la manière dont les enfants apprennent l'orthographe en nous appuyant sur une évaluation de la recherche récente en matière de développement des compétences en lecture et en écriture des enfants francophones et anglophones. Nous nous penchons sur la question de l'apprentissage des codes graphotactiques (combinaisons de lettres admises), après quoi nous examinons plus à fond la manière dont les enfants apprennent la position des morphèmes (les plus petites unités de sens de la langue). Nous mettons en lumière les différences entre les résultats de la recherche récente et les modèles traditionnels voulant que les enfants se servent de l'information graphotactique et morphologique relativement tard dans leur apprentissage de l'orthographe, et selon lesquels le développement des compétences, en particulier la reconnaissance des codes morphologiques, s'appuie essentiellement sur l'apprentissage des règles d'orthographe. En fait, il semble que les enfants en très bas âge soient influencés, dans leur apprentissage de l'orthographe, par les structures graphotactiques comme par les structures morphologiques et qu'en définitive, ils ne dépendent pas exclusivement des règles pour écrire. C'est pourquoi nous formulons la possibilité que les enfants pourraient apprendre à reconnaître les codes graphotactiques et morphologiques de l'orthographe par apprentissage statistique.},

We asked younger (Grades 1 and 2) and older (Grades 3 and 4) elementary school–aged children to choose the correct endings for words that varied in their morphological structure. We tested the impacts of semantic frequency by including three types of words ending in -er: derived and inflected forms, the first of which are far more frequent across the language, and one-morpheme control forms. Both younger and older children were more likely to choose the correct ending for derived forms over one-morpheme control words. This difference emerged for inflected forms only for the older children. We also tested the impacts of orthographic frequency by contrasting performance on the two derived allomorphs -er and -or, the first of which is far more frequent, and comparison one-morpheme forms. Both younger and older children were more likely to choose the correct spelling for the derivational -er over the same letter pattern in control words. This difference did not emerge in either group for the -or ending. The implications of these findings for current models of children's spelling development are discussed.},

I then summarize the view that the amplitude of the N400 is proportional to difficulty and indexes the efforts deployed by the brain to integrate the meaning of a stimulus in its context. While this view accounts for many literature data, its shortcomings are also pointed out. The need for various inhibition processes is then emphasized together with the idea that integration difficulty may vary with the amount of inhibition to be performed. Consequently, I stress the view that N400 amplitude could index inhibition rather than integration. The fact that, when presented with incongruous sentence endings, subjects are aware of the meanings of both the sentence frame and the ending has an important consequence on this N400 inhibition view. It means that disconfirmed contexts are not inhibited in some conditions, such as when incongruency is relevant in the situation. To account for this fact, the inhibition the N400 could index has to start only once this relevance is coded, that is, at or after the activation of situational representations. We then show that the idea that the N400 reflects such a late inhibition process may account for literature data that are difficult to account for by the integration view. Further studies are thus needed to test this inhibition idea.},

  abstract = {The processing of English noun-noun compounds (NNCs) was investigated to identify the extent and nature of differences between the performance of native speakers of English and advanced Spanish and German non-native speakers of English. The study sought to establish whether the word order of the equivalent structure in the non-native speakers' mothertongue (L1) had an influence on their processing of NNCs in their second language (L2), and whether this influence was due to differences in grammatical representation (i.e., incomplete acquisition of the relevant structure) or processing effects. Two mask-primed lexical decision experiments were conducted in which compounds were presented with their constituent nouns in licit vs. reversed order. The first experiment used a speeded lexical decision task with reaction time registration, and the second a delayed lexical decision task with EEG registration. There were no significant group differences in accuracy in the licit word order condition, suggesting that the grammatical representation had been fully acquired by the non-native speakers. However, the Spanish speakers made slightly more errors with the reversed order and had longer response times, suggesting an L1 interference effect (as the reverse order matches the licit word order in Spanish). The EEG data, analyzed with generalized additive mixed models, further supported this hypothesis. The EEG waveform of the non-native speakers was characterized by a slightly later onset N400 in the violation condition (reversed constituent order). Compound frequency predicted the amplitude of the EEG signal for the licit word order for native speakers, but for the reversed constituent order for Spanish speakers—the licit order in their L1—supporting the hypothesis that Spanish speakers are affected by interferences from their L1. The pattern of results for the German speakers in the violation condition suggested a strong conflict arising due to licit constituents being presented in an order that conflicts with the expected order in both their L1 and L2.},

Unlike the anomalous words, which evoked a robust N400 effect (on the CW in experiments 1 and 2 as well as on the sentence-final word in experiment 2), CWs in the metaphorical, relative to the literal, sentences only evoked an early, localized N400 effect that was over by 400ms after CW onset, suggesting that, by this time, their metaphorical meaning had been accessed. CWs in the metaphorical sentences also evoked a significantly larger LPC (Late Positive Component) than in the literal sentences. We suggest that this LPC reflected additional analysis that resolved a conflict between the implausibility of the literal sentence interpretation and the match between the metaphorical meaning of the CW, the context and stored information within semantic memory, resulting from early access to both literal and figurative meanings of the CWs.},

We propose a tentative neuronal model according to which part of the occipito-temporal ‘what’ pathway is tuned to writing and forms a hierarchy of local combination detectors sensitive to increasingly larger fragments of words.

Exp 1 compares the Family size effect for simplex nouns with the effect for simplex verbs in order to ascertain whether the word category of a simplex word affects the extent to which its family members are activated in the mental lexicon. Exp 2 shifts attention from monomorphemic words to complex words. Exp 3 addresses the question to what extent the presence or absence of an inflectional suffix affects the activation of the family members. Exp 4 explored the Family size effect for perfect participles. Ss were 198 native Dutch speakers. Results from Exp 1 found a similar effect of Family size for verbs without a nominal conversion alternant as for nouns without a verbal conversion alternant. No significant difference could be observed in the response latencies in Exp 2. Exp 3 showed that the Family size effect for complex words has a genuine morphological component independent of a semantic component. Exp 4 revealed an effect of Family size on both kinds of participles. The present study makes clear that the immediate morphological context in which a monomorphemic verb appears mediates the Family size effect.

When Dutch compounds are written with an artificial space, they reveal no effect of type count, which shows that the differential effect for the English open compounds is not superficial. The final experiment provides converging evidence for the lexical consequences of the space in English compounds. Decision latencies for English simplex words are better predicted from counts of the morphological family that include concatenated and hyphenated but not open family members.

This makes the process of creating an experiment slow and challenging, particularly for researchers who lack a Web development background. This article introduces jsPsych, a JavaScript library for the development of Web-based experiments. jsPsych formalizes a way of describing experiments that is much simpler than writing the entire experiment from scratch. jsPsych then executes these descriptions automatically, handling the flow from one task to another. The jsPsych library is open-source and designed to be expanded by the research community. The project is available online at www.jspsych.org.},

Available functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive ‘pop’ functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A ‘plug-in’ facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.},

In particular, a Prosodic Licensing approach to these issues provides a framework for understanding why children’s early use of grammatical morphemes is so variable. This in turn provides a means for making predictions, given the prosodic structure of a particular language and the location of a particular grammatical morpheme, if it is likely to be produced or not. Given that many of the patterns of development found in typically developing children are found in older children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) as well, the Prosodic Licensing Hypothesis should provide a better understanding of some of the variable use of grammatical morphemes found in children with SLI.},

The present study tested a fundamental claim about the nature of individual differences in reasoning and the processing demands of both systems. Participants varying in working memory capacity performed a reasoning task while their executive resources were burdened with a secondary task. Results were consistent with the dual-process claim: The executive burden hampered correct reasoning when the believability of a conclusion conflicted with its logical validity, but not when beliefs cued the correct response. However, although participants with high working memory spans performed better than those with lower spans in cases of a conflict, all reasoners showed similar effects of load. The findings support the idea that there are two reasoning systems with differential processing demands, but constitute evidence against qualitative individual differences in the human reasoning machinery.},

  abstract = {The role of sensory-motor systems in conceptual understanding has been controversial. It has been proposed that many abstract concepts are understood metaphorically through concrete sensory-motor domains such as actions. Using fMRI, we compared neural responses with literal action (Lit; The daughter grasped the flowers), metaphoric action (Met; The public grasped the idea), and abstract (Abs; The public understood the idea) sentences of varying familiarity. Both Lit and Met sentences activated the left anterior inferior parietal lobule, an area involved in action planning, with Met sentences also activating a homologous area in the right hemisphere, relative to Abs sentences. Both Met and Abs sentences activated the left superior temporal regions associated with abstract language. Importantly, activation in primary motor and biological motion perception regions was inversely correlated with Lit and Met familiarity. These results support the view that the understanding of metaphoric action retains a link to sensory-motor systems involved in action performance. However, the involvement of sensory-motor systems in metaphor understanding changes through a gradual abstraction process whereby relatively detailed simulations are used for understanding unfamiliar metaphors, and these simulations become less detailed and involve only secondary motor regions as familiarity increases. Consistent with these data, we propose that anterior inferior parietal lobule serves as an interface between sensory-motor and conceptual systems and plays an important role in both domains. The similarity of abstract and metaphoric sentences in the activation of left superior temporal regions suggests that action metaphor understanding is not completely based on sensory-motor simulations but relies also on abstract lexical-semantic codes.},

Advantages of this method over block designs include the ability to (a) randomize trial presentations, (b) test for functional correlates of behavioral measures with greater power, (c) directly examine the neural correlates of temporally dissociable components of behavioral trials (e.g., the delay period of a working memory task), and (d) test for differences in the onset time of neural activity evoked by different trial types. Consequently, event-related fMRI has the potential to address a number of cognitive psychology questions with a degree of inferential and statistical power not previously available.},

Frost, K. I. Forster, \& A. Deutsch, 1997). In contrast to these findings, facilitatory effects were obtained for both roots and word patterns in the verbal system. In addition, verbal pattern facilitation was obtained even when the primes were pseudoverbs consisting of illegal combinations of roots and verbal patterns. Significant priming was also found when the primes and the targets contained the same root.

The chapter then discusses a circumscribed variety of linguistic determinism. This requires an elaboration of an account of the process by which children acquire complement-taking verbs, to clarify how syntax and semantics are intertwined in this area, and why desire and belief verbs develop along radically different trajectories. The author then responds to three different challenges that have been made to the linguistic determinism theory that the author proposes. At the end, a speculative theory is provided of the linguistic structures involved, using a notion of Point of View domains. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)},

It seems probable that the conceptual developments of early Theory of Mind form an essential basis for helping to fix at least word reference. In development from 2 to 4 years, no basis exists in research for conclusions about the direction of influence between language and Theory of Mind. At the stage of false belief reasoning, after age 4, the role of the mastery of syntactic complementation is highlighted as a representational tool, that is, language development assists reasoning. The paper presents a brief summary of Theory of Mind, ranging from its earliest beginnings in infancy to the appreciation around age 4 years that others might hold false beliefs and act according to them. For each development, the parallel language developments are described, and questions are raised about the interface between the two. In particular, research that might determine the direction of influence from one to the other is discussed. More work is called for, especially with nonverbal tasks, good experimental linguistic work and other special populations, that might allow a more precise delineation of how language and Theory of Mind interrelate at the interface.},

Children provide a strong test of a causal role for language in ToM development. Many deaf children have significantly delayed language acquisition, but they have age-appropriate nonverbal intelligence and active sociability. In this chapter the author first summarizes the findings of previous studies of ToM development in deaf children. These provide suggestive evidence that language acquisition is a fundamental contributor to children's mastery of reasoning about false beliefs. However, there are a number of flaws in the earlier studies, varying from small sample sizes to weaknesses in the measurement of ToM reasoning and especially of language acquisition in the deaf children. The author therefore describes the findings of a more comprehensive study of the relationship between language and false-belief reasoning in deaf children that was designed to eliminate these weaknesses. Two studies in particular are detailed in this chapter: one which studies the relationship between language and false-belief understanding in oral and ASL signing deaf children, and the second which studies teasing apart the relative effects of executive functioning and language on the mastery of false-belief reasoning by oral deaf children. The results of the first study argue for a strong causal role of language in the development of a representational ToM. The second study confirms the results of Study 1 that processing of false-complement clauses with communication verbs is the primary language predictor of the mastery of false-belief reasoning in the standard ToM tasks for deaf children.},

  abstract = {Morphology is the aspect of language concerned with the internal structure of words, and languages vary in the extent to which they rely on morphological structure. Consequently, it is not clear whether morphology is a basic element of a linguistic structure or whether it emerges from systematic regularities between the form and meaning of words. Here, we looked for evidence of morphological structure at a neural systems level by using a visual masked priming paradigm and functional MRI. Form and meaning relations were manipulated in a 2 x 2 design to identify reductions in blood oxygenation level-dependent signal related to shared form (e.g., corner-corn), shared meaning (e.g., idea-notion), and shared morphemes (e.g., boldly-bold, which overlapped in both form and meaning). Relative to unrelated pairs (e.g., ozone-hero), morphologically related items reduced blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the posterior angular gyrus bilaterally, left occipitotemporal cortex, and left middle temporal gyrus. In the posterior angular gyrus, a neural priming effect was observed for all three priming conditions, possibly reflecting reduced attentional demands rather than overlapping linguistic representations per se. In contrast, the reductions seen in the left occipitotemporal cortex and left middle temporal gyrus corresponded, respectively, to main effects of orthographic and semantic overlap. As neural regions sensitive to morphological structure overlapped almost entirely with regions sensitive to orthographic and semantic relatedness, our results suggest that morphology emerges from the convergence of form and meaning.},

This relatedness proportion (RP) effect was studied in a lexical decision task at a short prime–target stimulus onset asynchrony (240 ms), which is widely assumed to preclude strategic prospective usage of the prime. The analysis of the reaction time (RT) distribution suggested that the observed RP effect reflected a modulation of a retrospective semantic matching process. The pattern of the RP effect on the RT distribution found here is contrasted to that reported in De Wit and Kinoshita’s (2014) semantic categorization study, and it is concluded that the RP effect is driven by different underlying mechanisms in lexical decision and semantic categorization.

We predicted that letter transpositions would disrupt morpho-orthographic processing more than morpho-semantic processing.

Similarly, Experiment 2 showed that although complex nonword primes (bankity-bank) generate significant priming effects relative to unrelated primes (farmity-bank), the same primes with letter transpositions (banikty-bank) do not prime relative to transposed unrelated primes (farimty-bank).},

The results do not show significant differences across the three experiments. In line with recent meta-analyses, we observed a graded pattern of facilitation across stem priming with transparent suffixed primes (e.g., viewer–view), opaque suffixed or pseudo-suffixed primes (e.g., corner–corn) and form control primes (e.g., freeze–free). Priming was largest in the transparent condition, smallest in the form condition and intermediate in the opaque condition. Our data confirm the hypothesis that bilinguals largely adopt the same processing strategies as native speakers (e.g., Lemhöfer et al., 2008), and constrain the hypothesis that bilinguals rely more heavily on whole-word processing in their second language (Clahsen, Felser, Neubauer, Sato, \&amp; Silva, 2010; Ullman, 2004, 2005). The observed pattern of morphological priming is in line with earlier monolingual studies, further highlighting the reality of semantic transparency effects in the initial stages of word recognition.},

  abstract = {Many computational models of visual word recognition and reading postulate a central role for phonology. None, however, has successfully simulated one key phenomenon associated with fast-acting phonological influences during word recognition: masked phonological priming (e.g., bloo primes BLUE better than blai primes BLUE). The tricky issue for computational models is not only to simulate such masked phonological priming effects, but at the same time to correctly read aloud irregular words. This double challenge constitutes a new benchmark phenomenon: the fast-phonology test. It has been previously shown that the dual route model of reading aloud (DRC) does not pass the fast-phonology test, unless it is assumed that lexical decisions are always made on the basis of lexical phonological activation. Here we show that the Bimodal Interactive Activation Model (BIAM), an extension of the interactive activation model, can pass the fast-phonology test, while maintaining the ability to discriminate between words and nonwords on the basis of orthographic activation alone. The BIAM achieves this by virtue of implementing a fast parallel mapping of letters onto input phonemes rather than output phonemes as in DRC. It is argued that the BIAM provides an improved architecture for a general model of visual word recognition and reading.

  abstract = {Two experiments examined priming from semantically transparent and opaque suffix-derivations (including pseudo-derived words such as corner), using the masked cross-modal priming technique. Experiment 1 showed that in a Dutch lexical decision task, latencies to root targets were facilitated when visually presented primes were transparent derivations of the target, regardless of whether targets were presented visually or auditorily. Pseudoderivations only provided weak evidence for priming and only when targets were presented visually. In Experiment 2 we tested transparent and opaque priming more thoroughly in a French lexical decision task by using the incremental priming technique in combination with a psychophysical approach. The results showed that opaque as well as transparent derivations facilitated the visual and auditory processing of their (pseudo-) root. However, transparent priming occurred earlier than opaque priming in the visual modality. Moreover, when facilitation from opaque derivations appeared in the visual modality, transparent derivations produced a larger facilitation effect. We argue that our findings illustrate the existence of two distinct processing systems underlying early morphological processing: a morpho-orthographic system and a morpho-semantic system.

  abstract = {In four lexical decision experiments, we investigated masked morphological priming with Dutch prefixed words. Reliable effects of morphological relatedness were obtained with visual primes and visual targets in the absence of effects due to pure form overlap. In certain conditions, priming effects were significantly greater with semantically transparent prefixed primes (e.g., rename-name) relative to the priming effects obtained with semantically opaque prefixed words (e.g., relate-late), even with very brief (40-msec) prime durations. With visual primes and auditory targets (cross-modal priming), significant facilitation was found in all related prime conditions, independent of whether or not primes were morphologically related to targets.

First, the model simulates lexical decision results obtained with French/English BLs in 2 masked orthographic priming studies (R. Bijeljac-Babic et al, 1997). Differences in the result patterns for Ss varying in 2nd-language (L2) proficiency are simulated by assuming a reduced frequency range for L2-words. In demonstrating that monolingual Ss likely knew some L2-words, the model displays heuristic value. Second, the BIA model simulates the effects of intra- and interlingual neighborhood density on target WR in blocked and mixed progressive demasking (PDM) with Dutch/English BLs (W. J. B. Van Heuven et al, 1998). The model accounts for a shift in result patterns observed in high-proficiency Ss over parts of the blocked PDM experiment by varying the degree of asymmetric cross-language inhibition from language mode to word level. The model also simulates overall results in the mixed PDM study by manipulation of cross-language inhibition and the frequency range for L2 items.

Cognitive linguists have since changed their conceptions about the nature of word meanings, and the interplay between words and their contexts. The traditional dividing lines between lexicon and grammar, and linguistic knowledge and encyclopedic knowledge have been largely blurred, and meaning is seen as a manifestation of conceptual structure, which is embodied and entrenched in the schematic network of structures and is extended on the basis of language usage events.

Final sentences resolved the anaphor with the correct (associatively related/contextually appropriate), incorrect (associatively related/contextually inappropriate), or control antecedent (associatively unrelated/contextually inappropriate). We examined the amplitude of the N400 component, which is thought to reflect the ease of semantic integration, at several points following the anaphor. The smallest N400 was evoked when the text referred back to a correct antecedent following an anaphor; an intermediate N400 was evoked by incorrect antecedents and the largest N400 was evoked by reinstating the control antecedent following an anaphor. Results demonstrated that, following an ambiguous anaphor, readers are able to use both lexico-semantic and discourse-level information to semantically integrate an antecedent into its larger discourse context.

  abstract = {How language users become able to process forms they have never encountered in input is central to our understanding of language cognition. A range of models, including rule-based models, stochastic models, and analogy-based models have been proposed to account for this ability. Despite the fact that all three models are reasonably successful, we argue that productivity in language is more insightfully captured through learnability than by rules or probabilities. Using a combination of computational modelling and behavioural experimentation we show that the basic principle of error-driven learning allows language users to detect relevant patterns of any degree of systematicity. In case of allomorphy, these patterns are found at a level that cuts across phonology and morphology and is not considered by mainstream approaches to language. Our findings thus highlight how a learning-based approach applies to phenomena on the continuum from rule-based over probabilistic to “unruly” and constrains our inferences about the types of structures that should be targeted on a cognitively realistic account of allomorphic representation.},

Form-related distractors facilitated picture naming in the immediate variant only, and to a lesser degree than compounds. Interestingly, the size of the morphemic effect was almost identical for semantically transparent and opaque complex words, which suggests that they share morphemic representations. These results suggest that morphological complexity in speech production is coded at the level of form representations, independent of semantic transparency.

At long SOAs the recognition of prefixed targets was facilitated by prefixed primes and inhibited by pseudoprefixed ones, whereas both prefixed and pseudoprefixed primes facilitated the recognition at short SOAs. In contrast, the recognition of pseudoprefixed targets was unaffected by the kind of prime presented, even when we used pairs of words overlapping in syllables that cannot be prefixes in Spanish.

Morphological priming, with pairs of words related by their stem (hijo/hija [son/ daughter]), produced a sustained attenuation (and even a tendency to positivity) of the N400 shown by unrelated words across the three experiments. Homographic priming (Experiment 1), using pairs of words with a superficially similar stem, but without morphological or semantic relation (foco/foca [floodlight/seal]), produced an initial attenuation similar to the morphological pairs, but which rapidly tended to form a delayed N400, due to the impossibility of integration. However, orthographic priming (rasa/rana [flat/frog]) in Experiment 2 does not produce attenuation of the N400 but an effect similar to that of unrelated pairs. Experiment 3 shows that synonyms advance more slowly than morphological pairs to meaning coherence, but finally produce a more positive peak around 600 msec.

Two experiments were carried out in which the priming effects for the previous categories were compared with unrelated priming and identity priming in a lexical-decision task. Morphological facilitation was obtained with 32 msec and 64 msec masked presentations of the prime word and with a 250 msec unmasked prime. However, semantic facilitation occurred only with the unmasked prime and orthographic facilitation occurred only for the masked primes. Morphological, orthographic, and identity priming effects were of comparable magnitudes for the 32 msec masked primes, whereas for the 64 msec masked priming, orthographic priming was half the magnitude of morphological and identity priming.

To test the sharing of conceptual relations across translation equivalents, Experiment 1 used the classical priming paradigm with specific methodological innovations, trying to satisfy various constraints that had not been addressed in previous studies. The results suggest shared storage for the conceptual representations of the bilingual's two vocabularies and asymmetrical links between concepts and lexical names in the two languages. Experiment 2 examined the details of meaning separation by eliciting semantic closeness rankings for conceptual relations that are equivalent across language translations and those that are not. The results indicate that bilinguals tend to integrate conceptual differences between translation equivalents, but that they also display a "separatist" tendency to maintain the L1 conceptual system in the representation of L1 words and to adopt the L2 conceptual system in the representation of L2 words.

With lexical decision and naming tasks, repetition priming and contiguous priming procedures, and masked and unmasked prime presentation, a pattern of results emerged with qualitative differences between the effects of morphological and form relatedness. With lexical decision, mere orthographic similarity between primes and targets (e.g., keller-KELLE, cellar-ladle) produced negative effects, whereas morphological relatedness (e.g., kellen-KELLE, ladles-ladle) consistently resulted in facilitation. With the naming task, positive priming effects were found for morphological as well as for mere form similarity. On the basis of these results, a model of the lexicon is proposed in which information about word form is represented separately from morphological structure and in which processing at the form level is characterized in terms of activation of, and competition between, form-related entries.

Partial correlations were computed for variables selected to reflect orthographic, lexical, and semantic processing, as well as for a novel measure of the visual complexity of written words. Correlations were based on the item-level ERPs at each electrode site and time slice while a false-discovery-rate correction was applied. Early effects of visual complexity were seen around 50 ms after word onset, followed by the earliest sustained orthographic effects around 100 to 150 ms, with the bulk of orthographic and lexical influences arising after 200 ms. Effects of a semantic variable (concreteness) emerged later, at around 300 ms. The overall time course of these ERP effects is in line with hierarchical, cascaded, interactive accounts of word recognition, in which fast feed-forward influences are consolidated by top-down feedback via recurrent processing loops.},

  abstract = {Masked affix priming effects have usually been obtained for words sharing the initial affix (e.g., re action- RE FORM). However, prior evidence on masked suffix priming effects (e.g., bak er -WALK ER ) is inconclusive. In the present series of masked priming lexical decision experiments, a target word was briefly preceded by a morphologically or orthographically related prime, or by an unrelated prime. In Experiment 1, the prime words in the suffix priming condition were formed by their suffixes (e.g., er -WALK ER ). In Experiment 2, the primes included the suffix inserted in a nonsense symbol string (e.g., \%\%\%\% er -WALK ER ). In Experiment 3, the primes were formed by a real word that shared the suffix with the target (e.g., bak er -WALK ER ). The results showed that, when compared with an orthographic priming condition, masked suffix priming can be obtained independently of the degree of segmentation of the prime. Furthermore, the present experiments reveal a clear dissociation between orthographic priming and morphological priming.},

In Experiment 1, Basque compound words could be briefly preceded by other compounds that shared either the first or second constituent, or by unrelated noncompound words. Results showed a significant priming effect for words that shared a constituent, independently of its position. In Experiment 2, compound words were preceded by other compound words that shared one of their constituents, but in a different lexeme position (e.g., the first constituent of the compound that acted as a prime was the second constituent of the compound that acted as a target). Results again showed a constituent priming effect (i.e., location in the string is not necessary for priming to occur). In Experiment 3, we demonstrated that these priming effects were not due to mere form overlap: pairs of noncompound words that shared either the beginning or the ending chunk did not produce a priming effect. Taken together, the present results converge with previous data on orthographic/morphological priming and provide evidence favouring early morphological decomposition.},

However, these findings have lately been called into question, and a recent article by Sánchez-Gutiérrez and Rastle (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 20, 988–996, 2013) suggested that the above-mentioned interaction could have been the consequence of a false positive (i.e., a Type I error). Considering recent evidence showing that morpho-orthographic interactions are highly sensitive to individual differences in reading skills, we explored whether participants’ averaged reading speeds were responsible for modulating the size of within- versus between-morpheme TL priming effects. A large-scale lexical decision experiment with a set of 420 suffixed Spanish words (N = 80 participants) was run using the masked-priming technique. The results revealed that individual differences modulated the magnitude of the masked TL priming effect between morphemes: Faster readers (but not slower readers) yielded greater TL priming for within- than for between-morpheme transpositions. The present data help reconcile previous divergent data by showing that faster readers revealed a morpho-orthographic interaction, whereas slower readers may rely more on a morphological-processing strategy that is not sensitive to morpho-orthographic interactions.},

In Experiment 1, unbalanced Spanish (L1)–English (L2) bilingual participants completed a lexical decision task on English targets that could be preceded by morphologically related or unrelated derived masked English and Spanish prime words. The cognate status of the masked Spanish primes was manipulated, in order to explore to what extent form overlap mediates cross-language morphological priming. In Experiment 2, a group of balanced native Basque–Spanish speakers completed a lexical decision task on Spanish targets preceded by morphologically related or unrelated Basque or Spanish masked primes. In this experiment, a large number of items were tested and the cognate status was manipulated according to a continuous measure of orthographic overlap, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of the role of form overlap in cross-language morphological priming. Results demonstrated the existence of between-language masked morphological priming, which was exclusively found for cognate prime-target pairs. Furthermore, the results from balanced and unbalanced bilinguals were highly similar showing that proficiency in the two languages at test does not seem to modulate the pattern of data. These results are correctly accounted for by mechanisms of early morpho-orthographic decomposition that do not necessarily imply an automatic translation of the prime. In contrast, other competing accounts that are based on translation processes do not seem to capture the present results.},

  abstract = {When does morphological decomposition occur in visual word recognition? An increasing body of evidence suggests the presence of early morphological processing. The present work investigates this issue via an orthographic similarity manipulation. Three masked priming lexical decision experiments were conducted to examine the transposed-letter similarity effect (e.g., jugde facilitates JUDGE more than the control jupbe) in polymorphemic and monomorphemic words. If morphological decomposition occurs at early stages of visual word recognition, we would expect an interaction with transposed-letter effects. Experiment 1 was carried out in Basque, which is an agglutinative language. The nonword primes were created by transposing two letters that either crossed the morphological boundaries of suffixes or did not. Results showed a transposed-letter effect for non-affixed words, whereas there were no signs of a transposed-letter effect across morpheme boundaries for affixed words. In Experiment 2, this issue was revisited in a non-agglutinative language (Spanish), with prefixed and suffixed word pairs. Again, results showed a significant transposed-letter effect for non-affixed words, whereas there were no signs of a transposed-letter effect across morpheme boundaries for affixed words (both prefixed words and suffixed words). Experiment 3 replicated the previous findings, and also revealed that, for polymorphemic words, transposed-letter priming effects occurred for within-morpheme transpositions. Taken together, these findings support the view that morphological decomposition operates at an early stage of visual word recognition.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) The issues discussed in this chapter center on the relations between children's talk and conversations and the development of their mind-reading abilities. Two particular interests frame the way these connections are examined herein. The first concerns the development of close relationships. The discoveries children make about others' inner states are central to the development of their relationships. The authors argue that a key entry into the community of minds (Nelson, this volume, chapter 2) may be through the experience of communication within close dyadic relationships--that communicative experiences within close, familiar relationships play an especially important role in the development of understanding of emotion and mind. The authors are concerned both with the concurrent relations among language, social understanding, and relationships and with the antecedent and consequent associations among these domains over time. Note that the focus here is upon the implications for theory of mind of the communicational aspects of language (the argument being that children become aware of people's mental states in part through conversations and stories), rather than the representational aspect of language (the argument that the development of prepositional language allows children to think about what is in people's minds when they [mis]represent the world). The second interest that frames the chapter is a concern with individual differences in each of these domains. Within the framework of this interest in individual differences, then, the authors consider here two issues. The first, the main issue with which this chapter is concerned, centers on the links between theory of mind and communication. The second issue, which is discussed more briefly, concerns the developmental patterns and processes implicated beyond the early preschool years. A focus on individual differences in communication and understanding of other minds highlights some key lessons and questions about the social processes implicated in children's discovery of the mind. Central to these lessons is the notion that children's language should be observed not solely as a cognitive skill or as an individual characteristic but also as a reflection of their participation in the social processes implicated in the development of understanding of mind. In what follows the authors raise a series of questions for discussion and highlight some cautions about inferences to be made from the evidence available on each of these issues.

Dupuis-Roy et al. reported a large positive correlation between the use of the mouth region and rapid correct answers [Journal of Vision 9 (2009) 1–8]. Given the chromatic information in this region, they hypothesized that the extraction of chromatic and achromatic cues may have different time courses. Here, we tested this hypothesis directly: 110 participants categorized the sex of 300 face images whose chromatic and achromatic content was partially revealed through time (200 ms) and space using randomly located spatio-temporal Gaussian apertures (i.e. the Bubbles technique). This also allowed us to directly compare, for the first time, the relative importance of chromatic and achromatic facial cues for sex categorization. Results showed that face-sex categorization relies mostly on achromatic (luminance) information concentrated in the eye and eyebrow regions, especially the left eye and eyebrow. Additional analyses indicated that chromatic information located in the mouth/philtrum region was used earlier—peaking as early as 35 ms after stimulus onset—than achromatic information in the eye regions—peaking between 165 and 176 ms after stimulus onset—as was speculated by Dupuis-Roy et al. A non-linear analysis failed to support Yip and Sinha’s proposal that processing of chromatic variations can improve subsequent processing of achromatic spatial cues, possibly via surface segmentation [Perception 31 (2002) 995-1003]. Instead, we argue that the brain prioritizes chromatic information to compensate for the sluggishness of chromatic processing in early visual areas, and allow chromatic and achromatic information to reach higher-level visual areas simultaneously.

Social studies was included on the assumption that comprehension instruction is required by the difficulty of social studies textbooks. Grades 3 through 6 were selected for the observations on the assumption that more comprehension instruction exists there than in grades 1 and 2. Major findings included the fact that almost no comprehension instruction was found. The attention that did go to comprehension focused on assessment, which was carried on through teacher questions. Instruction other than that for comprehension was also rare. It could not be concluded, therefore, that teachers neglect comprehension because they are busy teaching phonics, structural analysis, or word meanings. What they do attend to are written assignments. As a result, time spent on giving, completing, and checking assignments consumed a large part of the observed periods. Sizeable amounts of time also went to activities categorized as "Transition" and "Non-instruction." Other findings indicated that none of the observed teachers view social studies as a time to help with reading comprehension. Rather, they see their responsibility as covering content and having children master facts./// [French] Examine d'après l'observation en classes de lecture et d'instruction civique si les écoles primaires fournissent une instruction qui développe la compréhension en lecture des élèves. On a inclu les classes d'instruction civique sur l'hypothèse que, étant donné la difficulté des manuels, une attention toute particulière à la compréhension y serait nécessaire. De même, les classes de 3ème à la 6ème année ont été sélectionnées car on a pensé qu'à ce niveau une plus grande proportion de temps serait consacrée à l'enseignement de la compréhension en lecture que dans les classes de lère et de 2ème années. Pourtant, à la fin de la période de'observation, on a conclu que l'enseignement de la compréhension y était presque nul. L'attention qu'on y a porté s'est concentré sur l'évaluation du contenu des lectures sous forme de questions possés par l'enseignant. Toute autre sorte d'instruction étant fort rare, on n'a pas pu conclure que les enseignants négligeaient la compréhension en lecture en faveur de la phonétique, de l'analyse grammaticale ou du vocabulaire. Ils s'occupaient plutôt d'exercices écrits. Par ce fait, le temps requis pour donner, compléter et corriger ces devoirs prenait une grande partie des périodes d'instruction observées. Une bonne part du temps disponible se trouvait prise par des activités de transition entre sujets et par d'autres activités n'ayant aucun trait à l'enseignement. Aucun des enseignants observés ne semble considérer les classes d'instruction civique comme une occasion pour perfectionner la compréhension en lecture. Ils pensent plutôt que leur responsabilité est de faire assimiler aux élèves les faits./// [Spanish] Mediante observaciones en clases de lectura y estudios sociales, se trató de medir el grado de instrucción comprensiva que las escuelas elementales proveen.

La observación mas importante fue el hecho de que la instrucción comprensiva es casi inexistente. La compresión esta enfocada hacia la evaluación, la cual se lleva a cabo mediante preguntas por parte del instructor. Otros tipos de instrucción tambien fueron escasos. Por lo tanto, no puede llegarse a la conclusón de que los instructores tienen que dejar de lado la comprensión porque están demasiado ocupados enseñando fónica, análisis estructural o significado de palabras. Su atención está enfocada hacia asignaturas escritas. Como resultado, se observa que la mayor parte del tiempo se ocupa en dar, completar y revisar las asignaturas. También se ocupa gran parte del tiempo en actividades de tipo "transitorio" y de "no-instrucción". Otras observaciones indican que ninguno de los instructores observados piensan que los estudios sociales es el memento para proveer comprension oral.

They noted that this priming effect was smaller for balanced bilinguals than for less proficient bilinguals, although the interaction failed to reach significance. Findings of Gollan, Forster, and Frost (1997) suggest that this could be attributed to a greater reliance on phonology in L2 reading, caused by a smaller proficiency in this language. However, in this study we show that the Dutch-French cross-lingual phonological priming effect is equally large for perfectly balanced and less proficient bilinguals.

A second experiment replicated this effect when the same set of cognates was presented as the final words of low-constraint sentences. In a third experiment that used eyetracking, the authors showed that early target reading time measures also yield cognate facilitation but only for identical cognates.

The augmenters were blindly titrated at significantly lower dosage levels than the reducers. The ameliorative effects of the drug, as assessed by teacher ratings, were more evident in hyperactive augmenters. Ss diagnosed either as hyperactive or hyperactive and reading disabled had steeper (or more augmenting) gradients than the nonhyperactive reading-disabled and attention-disordered Ss. Auditory ERP augmentation appears to be related to the clinical diagnosis of childhood hyperactivity, but auditory ERP augmenters have neither more augmenting RT gradients nor stronger or weaker nervous systems than reducers. Results suggest that reducers either require or tolerate higher dosages of methylphenidate than augmenters and that hyperactive augmenters derive greater clinical benefit from the stimulant than hyperactive reducers.

Control Ss exhibited anticipatory HR deceleration more consistently than did clinical Ss, especially the solely hyperactive ones.

  abstract = {Electrophysiological research with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) is increasingly moving from simple, strictly orthogonal stimulation paradigms towards more complex, quasi-experimental designs and naturalistic situations that involve fast, multisensory stimulation and complex motor behavior. As a result, electrophysiological responses from subsequent events often overlap with each other. In addition, the recorded neural activity is typically modulated by numerous covariates, which influence the measured responses in a linear or non-linear fashion. Examples of paradigms where systematic temporal overlap variations and low-level confounds between conditions cannot be avoided include combined electroencephalogram (EEG)/eye-tracking experiments during natural vision, fast multisensory stimulation experiments, and mobile brain/body imaging studies. However, even “traditional,” highly controlled ERP datasets often contain a hidden mix of overlapping activity (e.g., from stimulus onsets, involuntary microsaccades, or button presses) and it is helpful or even necessary to disentangle these components for a correct interpretation of the results. In this paper, we introduce unfold, a powerful, yet easy-to-use MATLAB toolbox for regression-based EEG analyses that combines existing concepts of massive univariate modeling (“regression-ERPs”), linear deconvolution modeling, and non-linear modeling with the generalized additive model into one coherent and flexible analysis framework. The toolbox is modular, compatible with EEGLAB and can handle even large datasets efficiently. It also includes advanced options for regularization and the use of temporal basis functions (e.g., Fourier sets). We illustrate the advantages of this approach for simulated data as well as data from a standard face recognition experiment. In addition to traditional and non-conventional EEG/ERP designs, unfold can also be applied to other overlapping physiological signals, such as pupillary or electrodermal responses. It is available as open-source software at http://www.unfoldtoolbox.org.},

Being able to read words from memory by sight is valuable because it allows readers to focus their attention on constructing the meaning of the text while their eyes recognize individual words automatically. If readers have to stop and decode words, their reading is slowed down and their train of thought disrupted. This chapter examines theories and findings on the development of sight word reading.},

Using brain potential recordings, we investigated task-switching with ‚Äòunivalent‚Äô stimuli affording responses in only one of the tasks, and compared the outcomes to those recently obtained with bivalent stimuli (Lavric et al. [2008]: Eur J Neurosci 1-14), in order to examine two phenomena. First, when only univalent stimuli are presented, the processing of task cues becomes optional. Our results showed that in these circumstances linguistic (but not pictorial) cues were still effective in eliciting at least some degree of preparation for a taskswitch, as evidenced by the reduction in the error cost of switching at the longer preparation interval and by a posterior switch-induced ERP positivity at about 450‚Äì800 ms in the cue-stimulus interval. Second, single affordance stimuli not only reduced behavioural switch costs relative to bivalent stimuli; they also produced a smaller post-stimulus switch-induced negativity, consistent with the latter being a marker of conflict between task-sets. However, using stimuli not associated with responses in the alternative task did not completely eliminate the negativity. We speculate that the residue reflects other sources of conflict: attention to the irrelevant perceptual dimension and/or persistence of task goals.

  abstract = {ABSTRACTS This study investigated the effects of orthographic depth on reading acquisition in alphabetic, syllabic, and logographic scripts. Children between 6 and 15 years old read aloud in transparent syllabic Japanese hiragana, alphabets of increasing orthographic depth (Albanian, Greek, English), and orthographically opaque Japanese kanji ideograms, with items being matched cross-linguistically for word frequency. This study analyzed response accuracy, latency, and error types. Accuracy correlated with depth: Hiragana was read more accurately than, in turn, Albanian, Greek, English, and kanji. The deeper the orthography, the less latency was a function of word length, the greater the proportion of errors that were no-responses, and the more the substantive errors tended to be whole-word substitutions rather than nonword mispronunciations. Orthographic depth thus affected both rate and strategy of reading. Este estudio investigó los efectos de la profundidad ortográfica en la adquisición de la lectura en sistemas de escritura alfabético, silábico y logográfico. Niños entre 6 y 15 años leyeron en voz alta en el sistema transparente silábico japonés hiragana, en sistemas alfabéticos de opacidad creciente (albanés, griego, inglés) y en el sistema ortográficamente opaco de los ideogramas japoneses kanji. Los ítem fueron apareados según la frecuencia de las palabras en las lenguas estudiadas. El estudio analizó precisión latencia y tipos de error de las respuestas. La precisión correlacionó con la profundidad ortográfica: el hiragana se leyó más correctamente que, en orden decreciente, el albanés, griego, inglés y kanji. A ortografía más profunda correspondieron menor efecto del largo de las palabras sobre la latencia de las respuestas y mayor la cantidad de errores tendientes a ser sustituciones de palabras completas, en lugar de no-palabras. En síntesis, la profundidad ortográfica afectó tanto la velocidad como la estrategia de lectura. Diese Studie untersuchte die Effekte der orthographischen Vertiefung beim Erlernen des Lesens innerhalb alphabetischer, syllabischer und logographischer Schriften. Kinder zwischen 6 und 15 Jahren lesen laut vor, im transparenten syllabischen japanischen Hiragana, in Alphabeten mit steigender orthographischer Tiefe (albanisch, griechisch, englisch) und orthographisch unscharfen japanischen Kanji-Ideogrammen, mit Einzelheiten kreuzweiseliguistisch verglichen auf Worthäufigkeit. Diese Studie analysierte die Genauigkeit der Antwort, Latenz und der Fehlerarten. Genauigkeit verlief korrelativ mit der Vertiefung: Hiragana wurde sorgfältiger gelesen als, umgekehrt, albanisch, griechisch, englisch und Kanji. Je tiefer die Orthographie, je geringer war die Latenz als eine Funktion der Wortlänge, desto größer war das Verhältnis an Fehlern aufgrund von Nichtbeantwortungen, und um so mehr neigten die wesentlichen Fehler Ganzwortsubstitutionen zu sein, anstatt Nichtwort-Falschaussprachen. Orthographische Vertiefung beeinflusste daher beides, Grad und Strategie des Lesens. Cette étude s'est intéressée aux effets de la profondeur orthographique sur l'apprentissage de la lecture avec des écritures alphabétique, syllabique, et logographique. Des enfants de 6 à 15 ans ont lu à haute voix avec le syllabique japonais transparent qu'est l'hiragana, avec des alphabets de plus grande profondeur orthographique (albanais, grec, anglais), et avec les idéogrammes orthographiquement opaques que sont les kanji japonais, les items ayant été appariés d'une langue à l'autre quant à la fréquence des mots. L'exactitude des réponses, leur latence et les types d'erreurs ont été analysés. L'exactitude est corrélée à la profondeur: l'hiragana est lu avec moins d'erreurs que, dans l'ordre, l'albanais, le grec, l'anglais, et le kanji. Plus l'orthographe est profonde, moins la latence dépend de la longueur du mot, plus grande est la proportion d'erreurs qui sont des non-réponses, et plus les erreurs substantielles tendent à être des substitutions de mots entiers plutôt que de mauvaises prononciations de non-mots. La profondeur orthographique affecte donc aussi bien la vitesse que la façon de lire.},

  abstract = {Young infants can learn statistical regularities and patterns in sequences of events. Studies have demonstrated a relationship between early sequence learning skills and later development of cognitive and language skills. We investigated the relation between infants’ visual response speed to novel event sequences, and their later receptive and productive vocabulary. Using a modified visual expectancy paradigm (VExP; Haith, Wentworth, \& Canfield, 1993), we tested 6-month-old infants’ speed at responding to novel but predictable contingent event sequences. In addition, parental reports and behavioral measures of infants’ vocabulary were obtained at 12, 16, and 22 months. In order to estimate the separate effects of linguistic input on vocabulary, maternal speech from a play session at 12 months was analyzed for lexical diversity and quantity. Results suggest that infants’ speed of responding to novel but predictable events at 6 months robustly predicted both receptive and productive vocabulary at 22 months. This relation cannot be attributed to general cognitive maturity, as measured by a standardized test (Bayley Scales of Infant Development; Bayley, 2005). Maternal input predicted additional unique variance in infant processing speed. The results suggest that infants’ capacity to quickly learn and respond to sequential patterns, over and above the quality of the speech input they receive, contributes to vocabulary size in the second year.},

  abstract = {In a semantic priming study, we investigated the processing of German–English homographs such as gift (German~=~“poison”, English~=~“present”) in sentence contexts using a joint reaction time (RT)/event-related brain potential (ERP) measure. Native German speakers with intermediate or advanced knowledge of English (N~=~48) performed an all-L2 (English) experiment where sentences such as “The woman gave her friend an expensive gift” (control prime: item) were presented, followed by targets (i.e., boss) for lexical decision. To test the role of global task effects during sentence processing, we presented half the participants (N~=~24) with a 20-min silent film narrated in German and half (N~=~24) with the film in English before the experiment. To address the development of task effects over time, we analyzed the first and second blocks of the experiment. The results showed a significant interaction between semantic priming, movie version, and block in both the RTs and ERPs: there was significant semantic priming in the RTs and modulations in the N200 and N400 components only for participants who viewed the German movie, and only during the first block. Results suggest that in an all-L2 sentence task with L2 pre-task priming (English film), decision thresholds are raised high enough to eliminate measurable influence of the L1 on the L2. Despite identical material, participants who viewed the German film had to adjust, or zoom in, to the all-L2 task. Implications of this zooming in process in are discussed in terms of the recent Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) model of bilingual word recognition [T. Dijkstra, W.J.B. Van Heuven, The architecture of the bilingual word recognition system: from identification to decision, Bilingualism: Lang. Cogn. 5 (2002) 175–197].},

Even so, differences in perceptual processing may substantially affect learning across modalities. In three experiments, statistically equivalent auditory and visual familiarizations were presented under different timing conditions that either facilitated or disrupted temporal processing (fast or slow presentation rates). We find an interaction of rate and modality of presentation: At fast rates, auditory ISL was superior to visual. However, at slow presentation rates, the opposite pattern of results was found: Visual ISL was superior to auditory. Thus, we find that changes to presentation rate differentially affect ISL across sensory modalities. Additional experiments confirmed that this modality-specific effect was not due to cross-modal interference or attentional manipulations. These findings suggest that ISL is rooted in modality-specific, perceptually based processes.},

  abstract = {We discuss theoretical approaches to blocking effects, with particular emphasis on cases in which words appear to block phrases (and perhaps vice versa). These approaches share at least one intuition: that syntactic and semantic features create possible “cells” or slots in which particular items can appear, and that blocking occurs when one such cell is occupied by one form as opposed to another. Accounts of blocking differ along two primary dimensions: the size of the objects that compete with one another (morphemes, words, phrases, sentences); and whether or not ungrammatical forms are taken into consideration in determining the correct output (relatedly, whether otherwise well-formed objects are marked ungrammatical by competition). We argue that blocking in the sense of competition for the expression of syntactic or semantic features is limited to insertion of the phonological exponents of such features (the Vocabulary items of Distributed Morphology) at terminal nodes from the syntax. There is thus no blocking at the word level or above, and no competition between grammatical and ungrammatical structures. The architectural significance of these points is emphasized throughout the discussion.},

The first experiment showed that morphological relationships can be represented independently of semantic relatedness. A large facilitatory priming effect was found for morphologically related words that were not semantically related (e.g. submit, permit). Significant priming was not found for words that were simply phonologically related (e.g. balloon, saloon). The second and third experiments indicated that suffixes do not have lexical representations that can be primed during lexical access; morpholgical priming was not found between words that shared a suffix (e.g. joking, typing). Formal models which propose separate lexical entries for affixes are not supported. Finally, phonological priming was observed when words shared a final syllable but not when they simply shared final segments. Models of word recognition which include a level of syllabic representation are favoured over those which do not.},

Effects of bimodal bilingualism on behavior and brain organization are reviewed, and an fMRI investigation of the recognition of facial expressions by ASL-English bilinguals is reported. The fMRI results reveal separate effects of sign language and spoken language experience on activation patterns within the superior temporal sulcus. In addition, the strong left-lateralized activation for facial expression recognition previously observed for deaf signers was not observed for hearing signers. We conclude that both sign language experience and deafness can affect the neural organization for recognizing facial expressions, and we argue that bimodal bilinguals provide a unique window into the neurocognitive changes that occur with the acquisition of two languages.},

This study investigated whether skilled deaf and hearing readers (matched on reading ability, but not phonological awareness) exhibit similar N170 patterns, given their distinct experiences learning to read. Thirty-two deaf and 32 hearing adults viewed words and symbol strings in a familiarity judgment task. In the N170 epoch (120–240ms) hearing readers produced greater negativity for words than symbols at left hemisphere (LH) temporo-parietal and occipital sites, while deaf readers only showed this asymmetry at occipital sites. Linear mixed effects regression was used to examine the influence of continuous measures of reading, spelling, and phonological skills on the N170 (120–240ms). For deaf readers, better reading ability was associated with a larger N170 over the right hemisphere (RH), but for hearing readers better reading ability was associated with a smaller RH N170. Better spelling ability was related to larger occipital N170s in deaf readers, but this relationship was weak in hearing readers. Better phonological awareness was associated with smaller N170s in the LH for hearing readers, but this association was weaker and in the RH for deaf readers. The results support the phonological mapping hypothesis for a left-lateralized temporo-parietal N170 in hearing readers and indicate that skilled reading is characterized by distinct patterns of neural tuning to print in deaf and hearing adults.},

Previous studies have shown that garden-path misinterpretations tend to persist into final interpretations. Results showed that both intelligence and processing speed interacted with ambiguity. Individuals with higher intelligence and faster processing were more likely to answer the comprehension questions correctly and, specifically, following ambiguous as opposed to unambiguous sentences. Inhibition produced a marginal effect, but the variance in inhibition was largely shared with intelligence. Conclusions focus on the role of individual differences in cognitive ability and their impact on syntactic ambiguity resolution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

The concept was extended (Brown-Séquard) and it was suggested that brain lesions caused functional rupture in regions distant from the injured one ("action à distance"). The term "diaschisis" (von Monakow), proposed as a new modality of shock, had its concept broadened, underpinned by observations of patients, aiming at distinguishing between symptoms of focal brain lesions and transitory effects they produced, attributable to depression of distant parts of the brain connected to the injured area. Presently, diaschisis is related mainly to cerebrovascular lesions and classified according to the connection fibers involved, as proposed by von Monakow. Depression of metabolism and blood flow in regions anatomically separated, but related by connections with the lesion, allows observing diaschisis with neuroimaging.},

First, in order to establish which putative learning phenomena are sufficiently robust to constitute a target for modelling, we ran large-scale elicited production studies with native learners of Finnish (N\,=\,77; 35–63\,months) and Polish (N\,=\,81; 35–59\,months), using a novel method that, unlike previous studies, allows for elicitation of all six person/number forms in the paradigm (first, second and third person; singular and plural). We then proceeded to build and test a connectionist model of the acquisition of person/number marking which not only acquires near adult-like mastery of the system (including generalisation to unseen items), but also yields all of the key phenomena observed in the elicited-production studies; specifically, effects of token frequency and phonological neighbourhood density of the target form, and a pattern whereby errors generally reflect the replacement of low frequency targets by higher-frequency forms of the same verb, or forms with the same person/number as the target, but with a suffix from an inappropriate conjugation class. The findings demonstrate that acquisition of even highly complex systems of inflectional morphology can be accounted for by a theoretical model that assumes rote storage and phonological analogy, as opposed to formal symbolic rules.},

However, the specific function of each of these regions is not yet clear. Here we present evidence that a particular area within human parahippocampal cortex is involved in a critical component of navigation: perceiving the local visual environment. This region, which we name the ‘parahippocampal place area’ (PPA), responds selectively and automatically in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to passively viewed scenes, but only weakly to single objects and not at all to faces. The critical factor for this activation appears to be the presence in the stimulus of information about the layout of local space. The response in the PPA to scenes with spatial layout but no discrete objects (empty rooms) is as strong as the response to complex meaningful scenes containing multiple objects (the same rooms furnished) and over twice as strong as the response to arrays of multiple objects without three-dimensional spatial context (the furniture from these rooms on a blank background). This response is reduced if the surfaces in the scene are rearranged so that they no longer define a coherent space. We propose that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment.},

However, the artificial and simplified nature of the stimuli used in the pioneering work on the acquisition of statistical regularities has raised doubts about the scalability of such learning to the complexity of natural language input. In this review, we explore a central prediction of statistical learning accounts of language acquisition – that sensitivity to statistical structure should be linked to real language processes – via an examination of: (1) recent studies that have increased the ecological validity of the stimuli; (2) studies that suggest statistical segmentation produces representations that share properties with real words; (3) correlations between individual variability in statistical learning ability and individual variability in language outcomes; and (4) atypicalities in statistical learning in clinical populations characterized by language delays or deficits.},

  abstract = {The present experiments investigated how the process of statistically segmenting words from fluent speech is linked to the process of mapping meanings to words. Seventeen-month-old infants first participated in a statistical word segmentation task, which was immediately followed by an object-label-learning task. Infants presented with labels that were words in the fluent speech used in the segmentation task were able to learn the object labels. However, infants presented with labels consisting of novel syllable sequences (nonwords; Experiment 1) or familiar sequences with low internal probabilities (part-words; Experiment 2) did not learn the labels. Thus, prior segmentation opportunities, but not mere frequency of exposure, facilitated infants∗ learning of object labels. This work provides the first demonstration that exposure to word forms in a statistical word segmentation task facilitates subsequent word learning.},

All these theories have in common the distinction between cognitive processes that are fast, automatic, and unconscious and those that are slow, deliberative, and conscious. A number of authors have recently suggested that there may be two architecturally (and evolutionarily) distinct cognitive systems underlying these dual-process accounts. However, it emerges that (a) there are multiple kinds of implicit processes described by different theorists and (b) not all of the proposed attributes of the two kinds of processing can be sensibly mapped on to two systems as currently conceived. It is suggested that while some dual-process theories are concerned with parallel competing processes involving explicit and implicit knowledge systems, others are concerned with the influence of preconscious processes that contextualize and shape deliberative reasoning and decision-making.},

The authors offer an applied approach, emphasizing doing research with simple in-text exercises that are more interactive than those found in most methods textbooks.They also provide examples of real psychology research, both from the research literature and, uniquely, from student research projects. This friendly and supportive presentation of the basics conveys to students the excitement and fun of the research enterprise and involves them in doing research rather than just memorizing another term for an exam.},

  abstract = {Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of “universal,” we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition.Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.},

Method       Children with SLI and normal language controls (ages 6;5–14;4 [years;months]) listened          to 21 min of a language in which transitional probabilities within words were higher          than those between words. In a second study, children with SLI and Age–Nonverbal IQ          matched controls (8;0–10;11) listened to the same language for 42 min and to a second          42 min “tone” language containing the identical statistical structure as the “speech”          language.                     Results       After 21 min, the SLI group’s performance was at chance, whereas performance for the          control group was significantly greater than chance and significantly correlated with          receptive and expressive vocabulary knowledge. In the 42-minute speech condition,          the SLI group’s performance was significantly greater than chance and correlated with          receptive vocabulary but was no different from chance in the analogous 42-minute tone          condition.

Rather, these participants demonstrated significant difficulties in remembering and discriminating between faces and cars.

  abstract = {There has been a growing interest in the differential role of various neural structures in implicit learning processes. The goal of our study was to clarify how focal lesions restricted to the basal ganglia interfere with different aspects of implicit visuo-motor sequence learning. A version of the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) of Nissen and Bullemer using a 12-trial sequence was administered. A total of 20 subjects with focal basal ganglia lesions caused by ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction and 20 matched control subjects participated in this study. The results indicate that subjects with focal basal ganglia lesions showed unimpaired implicit learning of a 12-item motor sequence. Subjects with basal ganglia lesions, however, had more difficulties improving their general proficiency with the reaction-time task independent of sequence-specific learning. We observed a tendency toward smaller regional volumes in the cerebellum and left pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) of subjects with basal ganglia lesions. Smaller cerebellar and pre-SMA volumes were related to lower implicit learning performance in the lesion group. The size of lesions in the basal ganglia was not related to sequence-specific implicit learning but had a significant influence on subjects' general proficiency for execution of the reaction-time task. We propose that implicit learning is achieved by a distributed network of cortical and subcortical structures. The basal ganglia seem to be responsible for adjusting to the general requirements of a task rather than for learning specific associations between stimuli that might be accomplished by premotor frontal areas and the cerebellum instead.},

Accordingly, major theoretical advances in the sciences have been frequently accompanied by the development of novel visualization tools and graphical conventions (e.g., the periodic table). Today, knowing how to make a graph is a critical component of any practicing scientist’s repertoire, allowing her to gain insight when exploring a complex data set, and to communicate empirical findings to other scientists and the public. This paper reviews evidence from the cognitive science and educational research literatures that bears on the question of how drawing, the most basic visualization technique, interacts with cognitive functions that are core to scientific thinking, including: observation, problem-solving, explanation, and communication. Expanding the role of graphical literacy in science education may carry the potential to better reveal to students the dynamic and inquiry-based nature of scientific thinking, especially in contexts where visual representations have traditionally been subordinate to linguistic and numerical representations.

In Experiment 1, this was tested and confirmed with dot patterns in which the degree of part decomposition was manipulated by grouping and segregation on the basis of dot color. The hypothesis also predicted that the face inversion effect can be eliminated with face stimuli if participants are induced to recognize the faces in terms of their component parts. In Experiment 2, this was tested and confirmed with whole, intact faces, in which the degree of part decomposition was manipulated by allowing participants to study them, initially, in either whole, intact versions or versions with parts presented separately.},

By virtue of their non-concatenative morphological structure, the recognition of complex words in Semitic languages has been argued to rely strongly on morphological information and on decomposition into root and pattern constituents. Here, we report results from a masked priming experiment in Hebrew in which we contrasted verb forms belonging to two morphological classes, Paal and Piel, which display similar properties, but crucially differ on whether they are extended to novel verbs. Verbs from the open-class Piel elicited familiar root priming effects, but verbs from the closed-class Paal did not. Our findings indicate that, similarly to other (e.g., Indo-European) languages, down-to-the-root decomposition in Hebrew does not apply to stems of non-productive verbal classes. We conclude that the Semitic word processor is less unique than previously thought: Although it operates on morphological units that are combined in a non-linear way, it engages the same universal mechanisms of storage and computation as those seen in other languages.},

Prior research has shown that the function relating ease of word recognition and initial fixation position in the word is not symmetric. Word recognition is generally superior when the initial fixation is left rather than right of the center of the word. This asymmetry in the function relating initial fixation position to word identifiability could be due to (a) hemispheric specialization, (b) reading habits, or (c) variations in lexical constraint. The present experiments tested these alternative explanations by comparing the effects of initial fixation position in prefixed and suffixed words in French and Arabic. The results show that, contrary to both the hemispheric specialization and reading habit hypotheses, the average initial fixation curves for Arabic are asymmetric neither to the left nor to the right but depend on the morphological structure of the stimuli, thus lending support to the lexical constraint hypothesis.},

  abstract = {At least a generation of teachers has considered the development of creative problem-solving behaviour to be a fundamental objective in elementary school visual arts. Many, it seems, have assumed that appropriate physical conditions and a positive psychosocial environment could adequately nurture intuitive expressive solutions. With a growing acceptance of discipline-based art education and artistry as intellectual activity, theoreticians and practitioners have started to question whether alternative methods, such as direct instruction, might enhance creativity and develop complex thinking skills. The answer is relative to how creative behaviour is defined, but there is a large body of research suggesting that studio problem-solving skills can be improved with practice and guidance. Selected findings are reviewed in this article, along with many field-tested exercises, to suggest how theory might be translated into practice. 	 RÉSUMÉ 	 Au moins une génération d'enseignants a jugé que l'adoption d'un comportement créatif pour venir à bout de certains problèmes était l'un des objectifs fondamentaux des arts visuels à l'école primaire. Beaucoup, semble-t-il, ont supposé qu'un milieu physique approprié et un bon environnement psychosocial suffisaient à nourrir des solutions expressives intuitives. Devant la reconnaissance de plus en plus grande de l'éducation artistique comme activité intellectuelle, les théoriciens et les practiciens se sont mis à se demander si des méthodes parallèles, comme l'enseignement direct, pourraient renforcer la créativité et développer des modes de pensée complexes. La réponse dépend de la définition qu'on donne de comportement créatif, même si quantité de recherches donnent à penser que les talents de résolution de problèmes en studio peuvent s'améliorer avec la pratique et l'orientation. L'auteur de cet article analyse des constatations choisies et quantité d'exercises qu'on a testés dans la pratique pour suggérer comment traduire la théorie en pratique.},

  abstract = {Recent neuropsychological and imaging data have implicated different brain networks in the processing of different word classes, nouns being linked primarily to posterior, visual object-processing regions and verbs to frontal, motor-processing areas. However, as most of these studies have examined words in isolation, the consequences of such anatomically based representational differences, if any, for the processing of these items in sentences remains unclear. Additionally, in some languages many words (e.g. `drink') are class-ambiguous, i.e. they can play either role depending on context, and it is not yet known how the brain stores and uses information associated with such lexical items in context. We examined these issues by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to unambiguous nouns (e.g. `beer'), unambiguous verbs (e.g. `eat'), class-ambiguous words and pseudowords used as nouns or verbs within two types of minimally contrastive sentence contexts: noun-predicting (e.g. `John wanted THE [target] but …') and verb-predicting (`John wanted TO [target] but …'). Our results indicate that the nature of neural processing for nouns and verbs is a function of both the type of stimulus and the role it is playing. Even when the context completely specifies their role, word class-ambiguous items differ from unambiguous ones over frontal regions by \textasciitilde 150 ms. Moreover, whereas pseudowords elicit larger N400s when used as verbs than when used as nouns, unambiguous nouns and ambiguous words used as nouns elicit more frontocentral negativity than unambiguous verbs and ambiguous words used as verbs, respectively. Additionally, unambiguous verbs elicit a left-lateralized, anterior positivity (\textasciitilde 200 ms) not observed for any other stimulus type, though only when these items are used appropriately as verbs (i.e. in verb-predicting contexts). In summary, the pattern of neural activity observed in response to lexical items depends on their general probability of being a verb or a noun and on the particular role they are playing in any given sentence. This implicates more than a simple two-way distinction of the brain networks involved in their storage and processing. Experience, as well as context during on-line language processing, clearly shapes the neural representations of nouns and verbs, such that there is no single neural marker of word class. Our results further suggest that the presence and nature of the word class-based dissociations observed after brain damage are similarly likely to be a function of both the type of stimulus and the context in which it occurs, and thus must be assessed accordingly.},

Half of the contexts were highly constraining. In both groups, expected words elicited less negativity 300-500 ms (N400) than unexpected ones, and unexpected words elicited smaller N400s when these were categorically related. Whereas younger adults showed the greatest N400 reduction to unexpected but related words in high constraint contexts, older adults showed the opposite tendency. Thus, unlike younger adults, older adults as a group do not seem to be using context predictively. Older adults with higher verbal fluency and larger vocabularies, however, showed the younger response pattern, suggesting resource availability may offset certain age-related changes.

Some interpret the (null) finding of equal facilitation after semantically transparent and opaque morphologically related primes in early stages of morphological processing as consistent with this view. Recent literature suggests that morphological facilitation tends to be greater after transparent than after opaque primes, however. To determine whether the degree of semantic transparency influences parsing into a stem and a suffix (morphological decomposition) in the forward masked priming variant of the lexical decision paradigm, we compared patterns of facilitation between semantically transparent (e.g., coolant–cool) and opaque (e.g., rampant–ramp) prime– target pairs. Form properties of the stem (frequency, neighborhood size, and prime–target letter overlap), as well as related–unrelated and transparent–opaque affixes, were matched. Morphological facilitation was significantly greater for semantically transparent pairs than for opaque pairs. Ratings of prime–target relatedness predicted the magnitude of facilitation. The results limit the scope of form-then-meaning models of word recognition and demonstrate that semantic similarity can influence even early stages of morphological processing.

Facilitation for targets that were related morphologically to their prime occurred regardless of filler context, but facilitation for semantically related pairs occurred only in the context of identity and semantic fillers. Facilitation was absent for orthographically similar prime-target pairs in all 3 filler contexts when matching numbers of orthographically similar word-word and word-nonword prime-target pairs rendered orthographic similarity uninformative with respect to lexicality of the target. Enhanced semantic and morphological facilitation in the context of identity and semantic relative to mixed fillers support a semantically attuned, as contrasted with a purely form-based, account of early morphological processing.

The identity condition consisted of the target (TURN). The morphological condition included a related form (TURNED). The orthographic condition consisted of morphologically unrelated words (TURNIP). Finally, no similar word was presented in the study phase of the no-prime condition. Morphological relatives included orthographically transparent (TURNED-TURN) and orthographically opaque (RIDDEN-RIDE) forms. The results indicate that performance of child readers on the fragment completion task was sensitive to morphological relationships. Completion rates following opaque, as well as transparent, morphological relatives were significantly greater than those following orthographically similar forms. In sum, the fragment completion task provides a viable tool for examining morphological processing in children and for differentiating morphological effects from effects of similar form.

  abstract = {In concatenative languages such as English, the morphemes of a word are linked linearly so that words formed from the same base morpheme also resemble each other along orthographic dimensions. In Hebrew, by contrast, the morphemes of a word can be but are not generally concatenated. Instead, a pattern of vowels is infixed between the consonants of the root morpheme. Consequently, the shared portion of morphologically-related words in Hebrew is not always an orthographic unit. In a series of three experiments using the repetition priming task with visually presented Hebrew materials, primes that were formed from the same base morpheme and were morphologically-related to a target facilitated target recognition. Moreover, morphologically-related prime and target pairs that contained a disruption to the shared orthographic pattern showed the same pattern of facilitation as did nondisrupted pairs. That is, there was no effect over successive prime and target presentations, of disrupting the sequence of letters that constitutes the base morpheme or root. In addition, facilitation was similar across derivational, inflectional and identical primes. The conclusion of the present study is that morphological effects in word recognition are distinct from the effects of shared structure.},

  abstract = {It is now well established that phonological -- and orthographic -- codes play a crucial role in the recognition of isolated words and in understanding the sequences of words that comprise a sentence. However, words and sentences are organized with respect to morphological as well as phonological components. It is thus unfortunate that the morpheme has received relatively little attention in the experimental literature, either from psychologists or linguists. Due to recent methodological developments, however, now is an opportune time to address morphological issues.   In the experimental literature, there is a tendency to examine various psycholinguistic processes in English and then to assume that the account given applies with equal significance to English and to other languages. Written languages differ, however, in the extent to which they capture phonological as contrasted with morphological units. Moreover, with respect to the morpheme, languages differ in the principle by which morphemes are connected to form new words.   This volume focuses on morphological processes in word recognition and reading with an eye toward comparing morphological processes with orthographic and phonological processes. Cross-language comparisons are examined as a tool with which to probe universal linguistic processes, and a variety of research methodologies are described. Because it makes the experimental literature in languages other than English more accessible, this book is expected to be of interest to many readers. It also directs attention to the subject of language processing in general -- an issue which is of central interest to cognitive psychologists and linguists as well as educators and clinicians.},

Results indicated that the magnitude of facilitation in the alphabetically alternating condition was not reduced relative to the nonalternating condition (rupi\^rupi vs. p\^rupi) which suggested that visual similarity is not a necessary condition for facilitation in the present task.

These results challenge claims that form-based, semantically blind activation underlies early morphological facilitation. Some have argued that the English materials in previous studies were not ideally constructed, insofar as the types of spelling changes to affixed stems differed in the semantically similar and dissimilar pairs. The present study exploited Serbian‚Äôs bialphabetism, rich morphology, and homographic (form-identical) stems to replicate early effects of semantic similarity. Furthermore, it incorporated within-target manipulations of prime type and of alphabet, such that the alphabets of the prime‚Äìtarget pairs matched in Experiment 1a and alternated in Experiment 1b. Importantly, no letter or phoneme changes occurred between the stems of the primes and targets. These results revealed significant effects of semantic similarity that are comparable with and without alphabet alternation. The semantic effects in Serbian replicated almost exactly those in English (Feldman et al., Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review 16: 684‚Äì691, 2009), which suggests that even early in the course of processing, morphemes are units of meaning as well as of form.

Abundant evidence suggests that emotionally salient stimuli and affective states can determine how visual attention is allocated. However, the brain regions mediating the effects of attention and emotion include shared and reciprocally connected structures. This raises an intriguing question about a reciprocal effect: Does attention also influence emotional responses? Here we review a series of studies that show that indeed it does. The results indicate that attention has a negative affective impact for otherwise neutral visual stimuli (abstract patterns and unfamiliar faces) that must be ignored or otherwise inhibited during the performance of a task. Finding that selective attention has distinct affective consequences for visual stimuli represents a new, fundamental discovery about the relation between the two main systems of prioritization in the human brain.

Here we extend the investigation of the effects of attention on behavior and show that prior attentional states associated with unfamiliar faces can influence subsequent social-emotional judgments about those faces. Participants were shown pairs of face images and were asked to withhold a response if a transparent stop-signal cue appeared over one of the faces. This served to associate the cued face with an inhibitory state. Later, when asked to make social-emotional choices about these face pairs, participants chose uncued faces more often than cued faces as “more trustworthy” and chose cued faces more often than uncued faces as “less trustworthy.” For perceptual choices, there was no effect of how the question was framed (which face is “on a lighter background” vs. “on a darker background”).

Process dissociations based on experimental manipulation of variables were derived from the most relevant theoretical properties typically used to contrast the two forms of reasoning. These include processing goals (Experiment 1), cognitive resources (Experiment 2), priming (Experiment 3), and formal training (Experiment 4); the results consistently support the author's perspective. They conclude that judgment under uncertainty is neither an automatic nor a controlled process but that it reflects both processes, with each making independent contributions.},

Traditional theories assume that sentence processing is algorithmic and that meaning is derived compositionally. The language processor is believed to generate representations of the linguistic input that are complete, detailed, and accurate. However, findings challenge these assumptions. Investigations of the misinterpretation of both garden-path and passive sentences have yielded support for the idea that the meaning people obtain for a sentence is often not a reflection of its true content. Moreover, incorrect interpretations may persist even after syntactic reanalysis has taken place. The authors suggest a "good enough" approach to language comprehension which holds that language processing is sometimes only partial and that semantic representations are often incomplete. Future work will elucidate the conditions under which sentence processing is simply good enough. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

More recent approaches predict improvement when problems are presented in frequency format or refer to natural categories. The present theory focuses on sampling processes. Experiment 1 showed that a seeming advantage of frequency over probability formats is due to a confounded factor, the need to mentally transform stimulus samples. An information search paradigm was used in Experiment 2. When sampling by the predictor, the probability to be estimated, p(criterion/predictor), was conserved in the samples and judgments were quite accurate. However, when sampling by the criterion, the low base-rate event was strongly overrepresented, accounting for the entire bias. Judgments were quite sensitive to the sampled data, but failed to take sampling constraints into account, as shown in Experiments 3 and 4.

In the psycholinguistic literature, one aspect of this debate concerns the psychological reality of the morphological complexity difference between compound words (teacup) and single words (crescent). The present study investigates morphological decomposition in compound words using visual lexical decision with simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG), comparing compounds, single words, and pseudomorphemic foils. The results support an account of lexical processing which includes early decomposition of morphologically complex words into constituents. The behavioural differences suggest internally structured representations for compound words, and the early effects of constituents in the electrophysiological signal support the hypothesis of early morphological parsing. These findings add to a growing literature suggesting that the lexicon includes structured representations, consistent with previous findings supporting early morphological parsing using other tasks. The results do not favour two putative constraints, word length and lexicalisation, on early morphological-structure based computation.},

Moreover, positing a morpheme-level route to complex word recognition entails not only access to morphological constituents, but also combinatoric processes operating on the constituent representations; however, the neurophysiological mechanisms subserving decomposition, and in particular morpheme combination, have yet to be fully elucidated. The current study presents electrophysiological evidence for the morpheme-based processing of both lexicalized (e.g., “teacup”) and novel (e.g., “tombnote”) visually-presented English compounds; these brain responses appear prior to and are dissociable from the eventual overt lexical decision response. The electrophysiological results reveal increased negativities for conditions with compound structure, including effects shared by lexicalized and novel compounds, as well as effects unique to each compound type, which may be related to aspects of morpheme combination. These findings support models positing across-the-board morphological decomposition, counter to models proposing that putatively complex words are primarily or solely processed as undecomposed representations, and motivate further electrophysiological research toward a more precise characterization of the nature and neurophysiological instantiation of complex word recognition.},

  abstract = {Advances in science are the combined result of the efforts of a great many scientists, and in many cases, their willingness to share the products of their research. These products include data sets, both small and large, and unique research resources not commercially available, such as cell lines and software programs. The sharing of these resources enhances both the scope and the depth of research, while making more efficient use of time and money. However, sharing is not without costs, many of which are borne by the individual who develops the research resource. Sharing, for example, reduces the uniqueness of the resources available to a scientist, potentially influencing the originator’s perceived productivity and ultimately his or her competitiveness for jobs, promotions, and grants. Nevertheless, for most researchers—particularly those using public funds—sharing is no longer optional but must be considered an obligation to science, the funding agency, and ultimately society at large. Most funding agencies, journals, and professional societies now require a researcher who has published work involving a unique resource to make that resource available to other investigators. Changes could be implemented to mitigate some of the costs. The creator of the resource could explore the possibility of collaborating with those who request it. In addition, institutions that employ and fund researchers could change their policies and practices to make sharing a more attractive and viable option. For example, when evaluating an individual’s productivity, institutions could provide credit for the impact a researcher has had on their field through the provision of their unique resources to other investigators, regardless of whether that impact is reflected in the researcher’s list of publications. In addition, increased funding for the development and maintenance of user-friendly public repositories for data and research resources would also help to reduce barriers to sharing by minimizing the time, effort, and funding needed by individual investigators to comply with requests for their unique resource. Indeed, sharing is an imperative, but it is also essential to find ways to protect for both the original owner of the resource and those wishing to share it.},

When joint probabilities did not differ, another higher-order statistic (conditional probability) was automatically computed, thereby allowing participants to predict the temporal order of shapes. Results of a single-shape test documented that lower-order statistics were retained during the extraction of higher-order statistics.

Ramon y Cajal seized on the method for a series of groundbreaking studies that provided convincing support for what came to be known as the neuron theory, in opposition to the reigning model of the time, the reticular theory. The retina was one of Ramon y Cajal's favorite tissues for study.

The three principal approaches to explaining this development—theory theory, modular theory, and simulation theory—are described first. Next comes a description of infant precursors or protoforms of theory-of-mind knowledge in infancy, including a beginning awareness of the intentionality and goal-directedness of human actions. This discussion is followed by a summary of the postinfancy development of children's understanding of visual perception, attention, desires, emotions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge, pretense, and thinking. Briefly considered next are intracultural, intercultural, and interspecies differences in theory-of-mind development. The chapter then concludes with some guesses about the future of the field.}

Findings from reliability analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested that extrinsic other (EO) items should be observed as a separate scale. Results also indicated an overlap between the extrinsic personal (EP) and intrinsic (I) dimensions, and that E bifurcated further. More specifically, MDS analyses indicated a clear pattern of grouping of the I, EP, extrinsic social (ES) and EO items clusters, where each one populated one of the quadrants in two-dimensional space, suggesting that the axes could be meaningfully labeled as "personal-social" orientation and "central-peripheral" status of religious sentiment, respectively. Thus, the instrumental dimension of religious motivation in this specific religious environment seemed to be linked to a peripheral nature of one's religious sentiment. Consequently, the peripheral space could be seen as a religious sentiment, but one that is limited, not interfering into other areas of life, but remaining compartmentalized.

The roles played by various moderating variables (e.g., relationship stage, individual differences) are also discussed. I conclude that bias in relationship judgments is largely functional and that interactions between partners both shape and are shaped by the directional bias and tracking accuracy attendant in relationship and partner judgments.

This study used visual lexical decision experiments with correlational designs to compare the influences of base morpheme frequency and family size on response times to derived words in English and to test for interactions of these variables with suffix productivity. Multiple regression showed that base morpheme frequency and family size were independent predictors of response times to derived words. Base morpheme frequency facilitated responses but only to productively suffixed derived words, whereas family size facilitated responses irrespective of productivity. This suggests that base morpheme frequency effects are independent of morpheme family size, depend on suffix productivity and indicate that productively suffixed words are represented as morphemes.},

Exp 2 tested whether the priming observed for bound stem items was any greater than would be expected on the basis of orthographic overlap alone using 56 Ss.

Repetition priming effects in lexical decision tasks are stronger for low-frequency words than for high-frequency words. This frequency attenuation effect creates problems for frequency-ordered search models that assume a relatively stable frequency effect. It was posited that frequency attenuation is a product of the involvement of the episodic memory system in the lexical decision process. This hypothesis was supported by the demonstration of constant repetition effects for high- and low-frequency words when the priming stimulus was masked; the masking was assumed to minimize the influence of any possible episodic trace of the prime. It was further shown that long-term repetition effects were much less reliable when the S was not required to make a lexical decision response to the prime. When a response was required, the expected frequency attenuation effect was restored. It is concluded that normal repetition effects consist of 2 components: a very brief lexical effect that is independent of frequency and a long-term episodic effect that is sensitive to frequency.

The experiment also suggested, however, that this difference in priming may have an episodic origin relating to the less formal similarity of derived than of inflected words to unaffixed morphological relatives. Exp II reduced episodic contributions to priming and found equally effective priming of unaffixed words by themselves, by inflected relatives, and by derived relatives. Exps III and IV found strong priming among relatives sharing the spelling and pronunciation of the unaffixed stem morpheme, sharing spelling alone, or sharing neither formal property exactly. Overall, results with auditory and visual presentations were similar. Interpretations that repetition priming reflects either repeated access to a common lexical entry or associative semantic priming are both rejected in favor of a lexical organization in which components of a word (e.g., a stem morpheme) may be shared among distinct words without the words themselves, in any sense, sharing a "lexical entry."

This ability to analyze and interpret an unfamiliar input string raises some important psycholinguistic questions. We are led to ask how this parsing is actually accomplished and what its role is in the recognition of familiar word forms. The Standard psycholinguistic answer to the latter question has been that the human parsing abilities at the lexical level are of only minor importance. Indeed, in modeling lexical processing, psycholinguists have not been particularly concerned with morphological productivity and its implications for lexical processing and storage. This neglect of productivity is clearly apparent in the default view of language comprehension which is assumed to be based upon two radically different processing mechanisms. The first is exploited during word recognition and involves retrieving information from a permanent memory store, the lexicon. The second mechanism allows the integration of the semantic and syntactic information associated with the individually recognized words and their order. These latter processes parse and construct novel sentential representations. Thus, the mechanisms that are capable of generating new linguistic structure are typically reserved for the post-lexical processes.},

MouseTracker provides researchers with fine-grained information about the real-time evolution of participant responses by sampling 60–75 times/sec the online competition between multiple response alternatives. MouseTracker allows researchers to develop and run experiments and subsequently analyze mouse trajectories in a user-interactive, graphics-based environment. Experiments may incorporate images, letter strings, and sounds. Mouse trajectories can be processed, averaged, visualized, and explored, and measures of spatial attraction/curvature, complexity, velocity, and acceleration can be computed. We describe the software and the method, and we provide details on mouse trajectory analysis. We validate the software by demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of its trajectory and reaction time data.

The repairrelated positivity preceded by a negativity displayed a centroparietal distribution, whereas the complexity-related positivity showed a frontocentral scalp distribution. These data indicate that the P600 is not a unitary phenomenon.

Temporal analyses of brain activation within this network support syntax-first models because they reveal that building of syntactic structure precedes semantic processes and that these interact only during a later stage.},

Subjects were required to decide whether two line drawings, presented sequentially, were the same or different on the basis of whether they were physically identical, shared the same name, or were in the same category. Subjects always made a choice “same’ or “different” delayed response whose meaning depended on the operative instruction condition in that block of trials. The ERPs elicited by S1 and S2 with this paradigm from both age groups were of complex morphology, with P300 to both S1 and S2, the E-wave preceding S2, and N400 possibly homologous for children and adults. P300, N400, and E-wave probably had similar functional roles for children and adults as attested by the lack of significant interactions between age groups and the cognitive variables manipulated in the experiment. However, group differences in scalp distribution for one of these components suggest that although they may be generically similar across groups, they are probably not identical with respect to brain generators. In addition, there were group differences in timing of P300 in the two age groups. Overall, the ERP findings suggest that the cognitive processing of children and adults in the same task is different, although the behavioral data lend only partial support for these conclusions.},

  abstract = {We explored morphological decomposition in reading, the locus in the reading process in which it takes place and its nature, comparing different types of morphemes. We assessed these questions through the analysis of letter position errors in readers with letter position dyslexia(LPD). LPD is a selective impairment to letter position encoding in the early stage of word reading, which results in letter migrations (cloud-could). We used the fact that migrations in LPD occur mainly in word-interior letters, whereas exterior letters rarely migrate.The rationale was that if morphological decomposition occurs prior to letter position encoding and strips off affixes, word-interior letters adjacent to an affix (signs-signs) would become exterior following affix-stripping and hence exhibit fewer migrations. We tested 11 Hebrew readers with developmental LPD and 1 with acquired LPD in 6 experiments of reading aloud, lexical decision, and comprehension, at the single word and sentence levels. We examined migrations next to inflectional,derivational,or bound function morphemes compared with exterior letters. Root letters adjacent to inflectional and derivational morphemes were treated like middle letters, and migrated frequently, whereas root letters adjacent to bound function morphemes patterned with exterior letters, and almost never migrated. Given that LPD is a pre-lexical deficit, these results indicate that morphological decomposition takes place in an early, pre-lexical stage. Morphologically complex nonwords showed the same pattern, indicating that this decomposition is structurally, rather than lexically, driven. We suggest that letter position encoding takes place before morphological analysis, but in some cases, as with bound function morphemes, the complex word is re-analyzed as two separate words. In this reanalysis, letter positions in each constituent word are encoded separately,and hence the exterior letters of the root are treated as exterior and do not migrate},

Using neurophysiological measures, the present study tested the predicted asymmetric disruption by assuming that coronal place of articulation for consonants is redundant.}

Novel words appeared either in contexts that were semantically constraining, providing strong cues to meaning, or in contexts that were weakly constraining, that is, uninformative. After each sentence, participants were shown the word in isolation and were asked to generate a close synonym. Immediately after training, words trained in high-constraint contexts elicited a smaller left temporal negativity (N300FT7) compared with words trained in low-constraint contexts, and both types of trained words elicited a stronger medial frontal negativity (N350Fz) relative to familiar words. Two days after training the N300FT7 disappeared and was replaced by a later, left parietal (P600Pz) effect. To examine robust learning, we administered a semantic priming test two days after training. Familiar words and words trained in high-constraint contexts elicited strong N400 effects. By contrast, words trained in low-constraint contexts elicited a weak N400 effect, and novel (untrained rare) words elicited no semantic priming. These findings suggest that supportive contexts and the use of an active meaning-generation task may lead to robust word learning. The effects of this training can be observed as changes in an early left frontal component, as well as the classical N400 effect. We discuss implications for theories of “partial” semantic knowledge and for robust word learning and instruction.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a critique of pure insertion. Pure insertion represents an implicit assumption behind many (but not all) studies that employ cognitive subtraction. The main contention is that pure insertion is not valid in relation to the neuronal instantiation of cognitive processes. Pure insertion asserts that there are no interactions among the cognitive components of a task. It is possible to evaluate and refute this assumption by testing explicitly for interactions using factorial experimental designs. It is proposed that factorial designs are more powerful than subtraction designs in characterizing cognitive neuroanatomy, precisely because they allow for interactions and eschew notions like pure insertion. In particular we suggest that the effect of a cognitive component (i.e., an effect that is independent of other components) is best captured by the main (activation) effect of that component and that the integration among components (i.e., the expression of one cognitive process in the context of another) can be assessed with the interaction terms. In this framework a complete characterization of cognitive neuroanatomy includes both regionally specific activations and regionally specific interactions. To illustrate our point we have used a factorial experimental design to show that inferotemporal activations, due to object recognition, are profoundly modulated by phonological retrieval of the object's name. This interaction implicates the inferotemporal regions in phonological retrieval, during object naming, despite the fact that phonological retrieval does not, by itself, activate this region.},

The general public is now more aware of the high prevalence of this lifelong disorder, with ca. 0.6\% of the population being affected. However, the signs and symptoms of autism are still puzzling. Since a biological basis of autism was accepted, approaches from developmental cognitive neuroscience have been applied to further our understanding of the autism spectrum. The study of the behavioural and underlying cognitive deficits in autism has advanced ahead of the study of the underlying brain abnormalities and of the putative genetic mechanisms. However, advances in these fields are expected as methodological difficulties are overcome. In this paper, recent developments in the field of autism are outlined. In particular, we review the findings of the three main neuro–cognitive theories of autism: theory–of–mind deficit, weak central coherence and executive dysfunction.},

The key component of our approach is to create a comprehensive 3-D EEG data structure including all trials and all participants maintaining the original order of recording. This allows straightforward access to subsets of the data based on any information available in a behavioral data structure matched with the EEG data (experimental conditions, but also performance indicators, such accuracy or RTs of single trials). In the present study we exploit this structure to compute linear mixed models (LMMs, using lmer in R) including random intercepts and slopes for items. This information can easily be read out from the matched behavioral data, whereas it might not be accessible in traditional ERP approaches without substantial effort. We further provide easily adaptable scripts for performing cluster-based permutation tests (as implemented in FieldTrip), as a more robust alternative to traditional omnibus ANOVAs. Our approach is particularly advantageous for data with parametric within-subject covariates (e.g., performance) and/or multiple complex stimuli (such as words, faces or objects) that vary in features affecting cognitive processes and ERPs (such as word frequency, salience or familiarity), which are sometimes hard to control experimentally or might themselves constitute variables of interest. The present dataset was recorded from 40 participants who performed a visual search task on previously unfamiliar objects, presented either visually intact or blurred. MATLAB as well as R scripts are provided that can be adapted to different datasets.},

It examines visual word recognition, speech perception, and speech production. Finally, it offers a wide array of experimental methods, including masked priming, long-term priming, the monitoring of eye movements, and recording of electrophysiological measures. The cross-linguistic perspective that characterizes the research effort of the present volume, as well as the previous ones, addresses the question whether there are qualitative differences in the principles of lexical organization and lexical processing in different alphabetic orthographies which arise from qualitative differences in morphological structure. To what extent can our findings in a given language be extended to another one? Any model of reading that considers the processing of morphological information should be concerned with its applicability to various writing systems and linguistic structures. The parallel monitoring of morphological processing in reading, speech perception and production provides converging evidence regarding the nature of morphemic representations. Finally, the richness of experimental methods highlights with impressive clarity whether our theoretical conclusions reflect the idiosyncratic features of a given task or not, pinpointing with increasing precision the various stages of morphological processing and their time courses.

  abstract = {Most Hebrew words are composed of 2 intertwined morphemes: a triconsonantal root and a phonological word pattern. Previous research with conjugated verb forms has shown consistent priming from the verbal patterns, suggesting that verbal forms are automatically parsed by native speakers into their morphemic constituents. The authors investigated the decomposition process, focusing on the structural properties of verbal forms that are perceived and extracted during word recognition. The manipulations consisted of using verbal forms derived from "weak" roots that have one consonant missing in some of the forms. The results demonstrated that if 1 consonant is missing, the parsing system collapses, and there is no evidence for morphological priming. In contrast, when a random consonant is inserted into the weak form, the verbal-pattern priming re-emerges. This outcome suggests that the constraint imposed on the decomposition process is primarily structural and abstract. Moreover, the all-or-none pattern of results is characteristic of rule-based behavior and not of simple correlational systems.

However, recent studies examining whether there are commonalities in the learning of distributional information across different domains or modalities consistently reveal modality and stimulus specificity. Therefore, important questions are how and why a hypothesized domain-general learning mechanism systematically produces such effects. Here, we offer a theoretical framework according to which SL is not a unitary mechanism, but a set of domain-general computational principles that operate in different modalities and, therefore, are subject to the specific constraints characteristic of their respective brain regions. This framework offers testable predictions and we discuss its computational and neurobiological plausibility.},

In the present study, the role of these factors in morphological priming was examined, using cross-modal presentation. Ss were 96 undergraduate students. Exp 1 revealed that priming between morphologically related words in Hebrew is determined by higher level linguistic characteristics and cannot be reduced to phonological overlap. Exp 2 confirmed that morphological priming occurs in Hebrew even when primes and targets are not semantically related but, nevertheless, increases with semantic similarity. The results support the claim that morphological priming cannot be accounted for by considering semantic and phonological factors alone, and they exemplify the potential of using both masked and cross-modal priming to examine morphological processing.

Missing vowels had no effects on lexical decision latencies.

These axioms lead to different interpretations of the same data. It is argued that once the implicit axioms of competing theories in visual word recognition are explicated, a strong phonological model presents a viable and coherent approach. The assumptions underlying a strong phonological theory of reading are outlined, and 4 theoretical questions are examined: Is phonological recoding a mandatory phase of print processing? Is phonology necessary for lexical access? Is phonology necessary for accessing meaning? How can phonology be derived from orthographic structure? These issues are integrated into a general theory that is constrained by all of the findings.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, reading research has seen a paradigmatic shift. A new wave of computational models of orthographic processing that offer various forms of noisy position or context-sensitive coding have revolutionized the field of visual word recognition. The influx of such models stems mainly from consistent findings, coming mostly from European languages, regarding an apparent insensitivity of skilled readers to letter order. Underlying the current revolution is the theoretical assumption that the insensitivity of readers to letter order reflects the special way in which the human brain encodes the position of letters in printed words. The present article discusses the theoretical shortcomings and misconceptions of this approach to visual word recognition. A systematic review of data obtained from a variety of languages demonstrates that letter-order insensitivity is neither a general property of the cognitive system nor a property of the brain in encoding letters. Rather, it is a variant and idiosyncratic characteristic of some languages, mostly European, reflecting a strategy of optimizing encoding resources, given the specific structure of words. Since the main goal of reading research is to develop theories that describe the fundamental and invariant phenomena of reading across orthographies, an alternative approach to model visual word recognition is offered. The dimensions of a possible universal model of reading, which outlines the common cognitive operations involved in orthographic processing in all writing systems, are discussed.},

According to the Full Decomposition model, after the visual decomposition stage, followed by morpheme lookup, there is a final “recombination” stage, in which the decomposed morphemes are combined and the well-formedness of the complex form is evaluated. Here, we use MEG to provide evidence for the temporally-differentiated stages of this model. First, we demonstrate an early effect of derivational family entropy, corresponding to the stem lookup stage; this is followed by a surface frequency effect, corresponding to the later recombination stage. We also demonstrate a late effect of a novel statistical measure, semantic coherence, which quantifies the gradient semantic well-formedness of complex words. Our findings illustrate the usefulness of corpus measures in investigating the component processes within visual word recognition.},

However, an emerging perspective is that a more general procedural learning deficit, not specific to phonological processing, may underlie DD. The current study examined if individuals with DD are capable of extracting statistical regularities across sequences of passively experienced speech and nonspeech sounds. Such statistical learning is believed to be domain-general, to draw upon procedural learning systems, and to relate to language outcomes. Method DD and control groups were familiarized with a continuous stream of syllables or sine-wave tones, the ordering of which was defined by high or low transitional probabilities across adjacent stimulus pairs. Participants subsequently judged two 3-stimulus test items with either high or low statistical coherence as being the most similar to the sounds heard during familiarization. Results As with control participants, the DD group was sensitive to the transitional probability structure of the familiarization materials as evidenced by above-chance performance. However, the performance of participants with DD was significantly poorer than controls across linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli. In addition, reading-related measures were significantly correlated with statistical learning performance of both speech and nonspeech material. Conclusion Results are discussed in light of procedural learning impairments among participants with DD.},

  abstract = {The combination of a replication crisis, global COVID-19 pandemic, and recent technological advances have accelerated the on-going transition of research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience to the online realm. When participants cannot be tested in-person, data of acceptable quality can still be collected online. While online research offers many advantages, numerous pitfalls may hinder researchers in addressing their questions appropriately, potentially resulting in unusable data and misleading conclusions. Here, we present a cost-benefit analysis of conducting online studies in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, coupled with detailed best practice suggestions that span the range from initial study design to the final interpretation of data. These suggestions offer a critical look at issues regarding recruitment of typical and (sub)clinical samples, their comparison, and the importance of context- dependency in each part of a study. We illustrate our suggestions by means of a recent online experiment investigating cognitive working memory skills in adults with the learning disorder dyslexia.},

  abstract = {Our ability to explain and predict other people's behaviour by attributing to them independent mental states, such as beliefs and desires, is known as having a 'theory of mind'. Interest in this very human ability has engendered a growing body of evidence concerning its evolution and development and the biological basis of the mechanisms underpinning it. Functional imaging has played a key role in seeking to isolate brain regions specific to this ability. Three areas are consistently activated in association with theory of mind. These are the anterior paracingulate cortex, the superior temporal sulci and the temporal poles bilaterally. This review discusses the functional significance of each of these areas within a social cognitive network. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In answer to these, a framework is offered according to which TOM is jointly dependent upon language and social experience, and is produced by a conjunction of language acquisition with children's growing social understanding, acquired through conversation and interaction with others. It is argued that adequate language and adequate social skills are jointly causally sufficient, and individually causally necessary, for producing TOM.

  abstract = {From an early age, musicians learn complex motor and auditory skills (e.g., the translation of visually perceived musical symbols into motor commands with simultaneous auditory monitoring of output), which they practice extensively from childhood throughout their entire careers. Using a voxel-by-voxel morphometric technique, we found gray matter volume differences in motor, auditory, and visual-spatial brain regions when comparing professional musicians (keyboard players) with a matched group of amateur musicians and non-musicians. Although some of these multiregional differences could be attributable to innate predisposition, we believe they may represent structural adaptations in response to long-term skill acquisition and the repetitive rehearsal of those skills. This hypothesis is supported by the strong association we found between structural differences, musician status, and practice intensity, as well as the wealth of supporting animal data showing structural changes in response to long-term motor training. However, only future experiments can determine the relative contribution of predisposition and practice.},

  abstract = {In 3 experiments with undergraduate subjects, the authors examined the effects of phonological resyllabification processes on the perception of French speech. Enchainment involves the resyllabification of a word-final consonant across a syllable boundary (e.g., in chaque avion, the /k/ crosses the syllable boundary to become syllable-initial). Liaison involves a further process of realization of a latent consonant, alongside resyllabification (e.g., the /t/ in petit avion). If the syllable is a dominant unit of perception in French (J. Mehler et al, 1981), these processes should cause problems for recognition of the following word. A cross-modal priming experiment showed no cost attached to either type of resyllabification in terms of reduced activation of the following word. Furthermore, word- and sequence-monitoring experiments again showed no cost and suggested that the recognition of vowel-initial words may be facilitated when they are preceded by a word that had undergone resyllabification through enchainment or liaison. The authors examined the sources of information that could underpin facilitation and propose a refinement of the syllable's role in the perception of French speech.

In its simplest version, the network consists of separate simple recurrent subnetworks for root and inflection identification; both networks take the phone sequence as inputs. It is shown that the performance of the two separate modular networks is superior to a single network responsible for both root and inflection identification. In a more elaborate version of the model, the network learns to use separate hidden-layer modules to solve the separate tasks of root and inflection identification.},

The central idea is that all metaphors involve structural alignment of the target and base domains.

Various evidence from cognitive linguistics, philosophy, and psychology are described in support of this claim.

  abstract = {A major revolution in the study of metaphor occurred 30 years ago with the introduction of “conceptual metaphor theory” (CMT). Unlike previous theories of metaphor and metaphorical meaning, CMT proposed that metaphor is not just an aspect of language, but a fundamental part of human thought. Indeed, most metaphorical language arises from preexisting patterns of metaphorical thought or conceptual metaphors. This article provides an evaluation of the linguistic and psychological evidence supporting CMT, and responds to some of the criticisms of CMT offered by scholars within cognitive science. Some new ways of thinking of conceptual metaphors from the perspective of embodied simulations and dynamical systems theory are also presented.},

Most linguistic and philosophical theories assume that sentences have well-specified literal meanings which represent the meaning of a sentence independent of context. Recent debate on this issue has centered on whether literal meaning can be equated with context-free meaning, or whether a sentence's literal meaning is determined only given a set of background assumptions. Neither of these positions meet the demands of a psychological theory of language understanding. Sentences do not have well-defined literal meanings, regardless of whether these are determined in light of a set of background assumptions. Moreover, the putative literal meanings of sentences do not contribute in systematic ways toward the understanding of speakers' utterance meanings. These observations suggest that the distinctions between literal and metaphoric meanings, and between semantics and pragmatics, have little psychological validity.},

My goal in this article is to argue that metaphoric cognition is fundamentally linked to human social activities. I defend this idea by focusing not only on metaphor use in overt communicative situations, but by suggesting ways that individual metaphoric cognition is implicitly social. Many of the experimental tasks used in psychology to demonstrate the psychological reality of conceptual metaphors reflect intricate couplings between cognitive and social processes. This argument demands a reorientation in how metaphor scholars interpret empirical findings related to conceptual metaphor theory, and more broadly aims to dissolve the long-standing theoretical divide between metaphoric cognition and metaphoric communication.},

My claim in this paper is that part of our ability to make sense of metaphorical language, both individual utterances and extended narratives, resides in the automatic construction of a simulation whereby we imagine performing the bodily actions referred to in the language. Thus, understanding metaphorical expressions like ‘grasp a concept’ or ‘get over’ an emotion involve simulating what it must be like to engage in these specific activities, even though these actions are, strictly speaking, impossible to physically perform. This process of building a simulation, one that is fundamentally embodied in being constrained by past and present bodily experiences, has specific consequences for how verbal metaphors are understood, and how cognitive scientists, more generally, characterize the nature of metaphorical language and thought.},

This article situates CMT within the multidisciplinary study of discourse processes, noting the long tradition in psychology of exploring how people's background knowledge and experience constrain discourse understanding and how psychologists have long sought links between patterns of talk and schemas in mind. This work suggests that alternative proposals on why people speak metaphorically and behave as they do in psycholinguistic experiments are, perhaps, complementary to CMT, but do not replace the theory in any significant way. Multiple, interacting constraints shape people's ongoing metaphoric thought and language, with conceptual metaphors remaining a major force in any comprehensive theory of metaphor.},

Some scholars have claimed that these signals give evidence of “deliberate metaphor” use on the part of speakers and writers. So, understanding these particular uses of metaphor requires people to infer deliberation, which leads them to pay greater notice to these figures and enhances their understanding of the cross-domain mappings motivating metaphorical utterances. Many linguistic analyses argue that deliberate metaphor is a critical part of metaphor use, yet no empirical study has explored whether people really infer greater deliberation and cross-domain mappings when encountering so-called pragmatic signals of metaphor. The present study tested this idea and did not find evidence in support of the deliberate metaphor proposal. This conclusion raises serious doubts about the psychological validity of the idea that some metaphors are produced and understood as being deliberate.},

But the empirical findings on metaphor in psycholinguistics are quite complex. Although significant research supports some claims of cognitive linguistics, especially its advocacy of conceptual metaphor theory, there are also contradictory findings along with several alternative theories of metaphor not seriously considered by cognitive linguists. The present article outlines some of the complexities in psycholinguistic studies on metaphor, and suggests ways to account for this diversity of research findings. Both linguists and psychologists should not assume that a single theoretical model will account for the complex empirical findings, because all metaphoric behaviors depend on the people being studied, the specific aspects of metaphor language employed as stimuli, the explicit experimental task, and the methods used for assessing metaphoric comprehension. People’s in-the-moment metaphoric behaviors emerge from the interaction of multiple factors as part of human self-organizing processes. This perspective has several implications for how linguists and psychologists conduct, and interpret the results of, their empirical studies.},

Adopting a dynamic systems approach demonstrates how elements of metaphor performance that have been previously thought of as fixed or static are re-interpreted as potential emergent stabilities in the dynamical systems. This approach is applied to the analysis of a single conversation between two participants to get an overall impression of the interaction between these various forces when metaphor is produced and understood and to illustrate the stability and variability in metaphor performance.},

Transfer frequency was reduced when the problem in the military story was substantially disanalogous to the radiation problem, even though the solution illustrated in the story corresponded to an effective radiation solution (Exp II). Ss in Exp III tended to generate analogous solutions to the radiation problem after providing their own solutions to the military problem. Ss were able to retrieve the story from memory and use it to generate an analogous solution, even when the critical story had been memorized in the context of 2 distractor stories (Exp IV). However, when no hint to consider the story was given, frequency of analogous solutions decreased markedly. This decrease in transfer occurred when the story analogy was presented in a recall task along with distractor stories (Exp IV), when it was presented alone, and when it was presented in between 2 attempts to solve the problem (Exp V). Component processes and strategic variations in analogical problem solving are discussed. (26 ref)},

  abstract = {The work reported here experimentally investigates a striking generalization about vocabulary acquisition: Noun learning is superior to verb learning in the earliest moments of child language development. The dominant explanation of this phenomenon in the literature invokes differing conceptual requirements for items in these lexical categories: Verbs are cognitively more complex than nouns and so their acquisition must await certain mental developments in the infant. In the present work, we investigate an alternative hypothesis; namely, that it is the information requirements of verb learning, not the conceptual requirements, that crucially determine the acquisition order. Efficient verb learning requires access to structural features of the exposure language and thus cannot take place until a scaffolding of noun knowledge enables the acquisition of clause-level syntax. More generally, we experimentally investigate the hypothesis that vocabulary acquisition takes place via an incremental constraint-satisfaction procedure that bootstraps itself into successively more sophisticated linguistic representations which, in turn, enable new kinds of vocabulary learning. If the experimental subjects were young children, it would be difficult to distinguish between this information-centered hypothesis and the conceptual change hypothesis. Therefore the experimental “learners” are adults. The items to be “acquired” in the experiments were the 24 most frequent nouns and 24 most frequent verbs from a sample of maternal speech to 18–24-month-old infants. The various experiments ask about the kinds of information that will support identification of these words as they occur in mother-to-child discourse. Both the proportion correctly identified and the type of word that is identifiable changes significantly as a function of information type. We discuss these results as consistent with the incremental construction of a highly lexicalized grammar by cognitively and pragmatically sophisticated human infants, but inconsistent with a procedure in which lexical acquisition is independent of and antecedent to syntax acquisition.},

Responses to both free root and derived suffixed word targets were facilitated when primes were derived suffixed words containing the target's root, and this facilitation effect showed a time course similar to that for the facilitation effect of repetition primes (though systematically smaller in magnitude). In a control experiment only the longest prime duration of Exp 1 was used; responses to derived suffixed word targets were facilitated by both free root primes and derived suffixed word primes sharing the target's root (relative to unrelated and form-related control primes). The free root and derived suffixed word prime conditions did not differ significantly. In Exp 2, only true derived word primes produced facilitation, whereas morphologically simple primes containing a pseudoroot did not influence performance relative to the unrelated prime condition. We argue that this supports a supralexical account of morphological representation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

We suggest an alternative possibility: naive individuals are able to reason probabilistically when they can rely on a representation of subsets of chances or frequencies. We predicted that naive individuals solve conditional probability problems if they can infer conditional probabilities from the subset relations in their representation of the problems, and if the question put to them makes it easy to consider the appropriate subsets. The results of seven studies corroborated these predictions: when the form of the question and the structure of the problem were framed so as to activate intuitive principles based on subset relations, naive individuals solved problems, whether they were stated in terms of probabilities or frequencies. Otherwise, they failed with both sorts of information. The results contravene the frequentist hypothesis and the evolutionary account of probabilistic reasoning.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes English symmetrical predicates such as collide and match. Its point of departure is an analysis of the concept ‘similar’ from Tversky (1977) that appears to show that similarity is psychologically asymmetrical. One basis for this claim from Tversky is that the sentences North Korea is similar to Red China and Red China is similar to North Korea are assessed as differing in meaning by experimental subjects; this seems to imply that the symmetrical entailment (R x, y ↔ R y, x) fails for this concept. Five experiments are presented that show: (1) the apparent asymmetry of similar is reproduced for 20 predicates that are intuitively thought to be symmetrical, including equal and identical; (2) unique linguistic-interpretative properties hold for these symmetrical words, such as reciprocal interpretation when they appear intransitively, for example, North Korea and Red China are similar; (3) the asymmetrical interpretation of subject-complement constructions containing the symmetrical words is a consequence of general linguistic-interpretive principles. On the basis of the experimental findings, we offer an analysis of symmetrical predication. One major claim of the analysis is that symmetry is a property of lexical items and has no special syntax, that is, that John meets is semantically but not syntactically anomalous. A second claim is that the structural positioning of noun phrases in sentences containing symmetricals - rather than inherent semantic properties of the noun phrases themselves - sets their status as Figure and Ground (as described by Talmy, 1985) or Variant and Referent (as described by Tversky, 1977) in the comparison, even if the nouns are nonsense items. Finally, the behavior of symmetrical predicates is shown to vary as a function of their differing lexical class assignments and collateral semantic designations, such as activity versus state. Most generally, it is claimed that a deeper understanding of symmetrical terms comes from analyzing the semantics of syntactic structures in which they appear.},

  abstract = {Metaphors can be understood in either of two ways: via a comparison process or via a categorization process. What determines which process will be used? According to a recent variant of comparison theory, novel metaphors must be processed as comparisons; only conventional metaphors can be processed as categorizations. We argue that choice of process is determined not by conventionality, but instead by the semantic and referential properties of the metaphor itself. We identified a type of novel metaphor that is indeed understood more quickly as a comparison than as a categorization. We then generated variants of such metaphors to make comparison difficult and found that these new novel metaphors were understood more quickly as categorizations than as comparisons. We conclude that metaphors can be processed as categorizations from the start, depending on their semantic and referential properties.},

If metaphors are understood as class-inclusion assertions, they should either change meaning or become nonsensical when reversed. Experiment 1 provides evidence for this claim. A second implication of the property attribution view is that topics and vehicles provide different kinds of information to guide and constrain the comprehension process. Experiment 2 provides evidence for this claim. These findings cannot be accounted for by models which assume that metaphors are understood as implicit comparisons.},

This property of metaphors is the basis for psycholinguistic comparison theories of metaphor comprehension. However, if metaphors cannot always be paraphrased as similes, then comparison theories must be abandoned. The different forms of a metaphor—the comparison and categorical forms—have different referents. In comparison form, the metaphor vehicle refers to the literal concept, e.g. ‘in my lawyer is like a shark’, the term ‘shark’ refers to the literal fish. In categorical form, ‘my lawyer is a shark’, ‘shark’ refers to an abstract (metaphorical) category of predatory creatures. This difference in reference makes it possible for a metaphor and its corresponding simile to differ (a) in interpretability and (b) in meaning. Because a metaphor cannot always be understood in terms of its corresponding simile, we conclude that comparison theories of metaphor are fundamentally flawed.},

A. Tversky's (1977) account of similarity is applied to such nonliteral similarity expressions, and is shown to apply as readily to nonliteral comparisons as to literal comparisons. But treating metaphors as comparison statements fails to account for certain important phenomena, including metaphoricity itself (the judgment that a comparison statement is nonliteral). We argue that metaphors are exactly what they appear to be: class-inclusion assertions, in which the topic of the metaphor (e.g., 'my job') is assigned to a diagnostic category (e.g., entities that confine one against one's will, are unpleasant, are difficult to escape from). In such assertions, the metaphor vehicle (e.g., 'jail') refers to that category, and at the same time is a prototypical exemplar of that category. This account of metaphor provides a basis for a theory of metaphor comprehension, and also clarifies why people use metaphors instead of similes.

Although this account can capture a range of facts, it is rejected for several reasons, the most significant of which is that it cannot discriminate between anomalous outputs and natural-sounding outputs, both of which are produced by impaired speakers. In view of this, a morphological account is proposed: The grammars of these impaired individuals lack certain sublexical features, in particular [+-plural]; the notion of plurality is expressed at the level of conceptual structure. Consequently, plurals must be built through compensatory means. They may involve the concatenation of stems and thereby structurally resemble compounds, both morphologically and prosodically. They may be stored as morphologically unanalyzed chunks. Evidence in support of both options is provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

The first covers four competing approaches to mentalizing such as the theory-theory, modularity theory, rationality theory, and simulation theory. The second classification is the first-person/third-person contrast. Jerry Fodor claimed that commonsense psychology is so good at helping predict behavior that it is practically invisible. It works well because the intentional states it posits genuinely exist and possess the properties generally associated with them. The modularity model has two principal components. First, whereas the child-scientist approach claims that mentalizing utilizes domain-general cognitive equipment, the modularity approach posits one or more domain-specific modules, which use proprietary representations and computations for the mental domain. Second, the modularity approach holds that these modules are innate cognitive structures, which mature or come on line at preprogrammed stages and are not acquired through learning. The investigators concluded that autism impairs a domain-specific capacity dedicated to mentalizing. Gordon, Jane Heal, and Alvin Goldman explained simulation theory in such a way that mind readers simulate a target by trying to create similar mental states of their own as proxies or surrogates of those of the target. These initial pretend states are fed into the mind reader's own cognitive mechanisms to generate additional states, some of which are then imputed to the target.},

  abstract = {Considerable behavioral research has demonstrated that the visual word recognition system is sensitive to morphological structure. It has typically been assumed that analysis of morphologically complex words occurs only when the meaning of these words can be derived from the meanings of their constituents (e.g., hunter = hunt + er). However, results from recent behavioral research using the masked priming technique have demonstrated that morphological analysis can occur at an earlier orthographic level, in cases in which the meanings of complex words cannot be derived from their constituents (e.g., corner = corn + er). Here, we combine the logic of behavioral masked priming with the neurophysiological phenomenon of functional magnetic resonance imaging priming suppression to look for evidence of nonsemantic morphological priming at the neural level. Both behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging results indicated priming effects associated with the mere appearance of morphological structure (corner-CORN). In addition, these effects were distinguishable from lexical-semantic effects (bucket-PAIL) and orthographic effects (brothel-BROTH). Three left-lateralized occipito-temporal regions showed sensitivity to early morphological components of visual word recognition. Two of these regions also showed orthographic priming (‚àºBA 37, peak: -48 -60 -17; ‚àºBA 19, peak: -40 -77 -1), whereas one was sensitive only to morphological similarity between primes and targets (‚àºBA 19, peak: -37 -67 -7). These findings provide a neurobiological basis for a purely structural morphemic segmentation mechanism operating at early stages of visual word recognition.

We found that novel metaphors elicited smaller N400 and greater LPC amplitudes when participants had explained their meaning during a previous exposure relative to unexplained ones. Interestingly, after explaining the meanings of conventional metaphors, they elicited increased N400 and reduced LPC resembling the waveforms elicited by explained novel metaphors. Our findings suggest that people are able to conventionalize novel metaphors and change their processing mode quickly.

  abstract = {Hebrew–English cognates (translations similar in meaning and form) and noncognates (translations similar in meaning only) were examined in masked translation priming. Enhanced priming for cognates was found with L1 (dominant language) primes, but unlike previous results, it was not found with L2 (nondominant language) primes. Priming was also obtained for noncognates, whereas previous studies showed unstable effects for such stimuli. The authors interpret the results in a dual-lexicon model by suggesting that (a) both orthographic and phonological overlap are needed to establish shared lexical entries for cognates (and hence also symmetric cognate priming), and (b) script differences facilitate rapid access by providing a cue to the lexical processor that directs access to the proper lexicon, thus producing stable noncognate priming. The asymmetrical cognate effect obtained with different scripts may be attributed to an overreliance on phonology in L2 reading.},

  abstract = {The visual aesthetics of an object increases visual attention towards the object. It is argued that this relation between liking and attention is an evolutionary adaptation in sexual and natural selection. If this is the case, we would expect this relation to be domain specific, and thus, stronger for biological than for non-biological objects. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two eye-tracking studies, in which we compared the relation between liking and gaze patterns in images of biological (faces) and non-biological (paintings) stimuli. In Study 1, we presented randomly combined image pairs for 20 s in a free-viewing paradigm. Participants then selected the image they liked more in a 2-AFC task and rated the liking of each image on a Likert-scale. In Study 2, we employed the same paradigm but this time, images were combined based on pre-rated liking to ensure that images in each pair were clearly different. In both studies, we found a strong relation between liking and visual attention. Against our expectations, these effects were of similar magnitude for faces as for paintings. We conclude that the relation between liking and visual attention is not limited to biological objects but that its effects are domain general. The evolutionary function of the relation between liking and visual attention might stem from evolutionary adaptations, nonetheless, this link seems to be a rather basic phenomenon that applies across domains.

  abstract = {The rapidity with which children acquire language is one of the mysteries of human cognition. A view held widely for the past 30 years is that children master language by means of a language-specific learning device. An earlier proposal, which has generated renewed interest, is that children make use of domain-general, associative learning mechanisms. However, our current lack of knowledge of the actual learning mechanisms involved during infancy makes it difficult to determine the relative contributions of innate and acquired knowledge. A recent approach to studying this problem exposes infants to artificial languages and assesses the resulting learning. In this article, we review studies using this paradigm that have led to a number of exciting discoveries regarding the learning mechanisms available during infancy. These studies raise important issues with respect to whether such mechanisms are general or specific to language, the extent to which they reflect statistical learning versus symbol manipulation, and the extent to which such mechanisms change with development. The fine-grained characterizations of infant learning mechanisms that this approach permits should result in a better understanding of the relative contributions of, and the dynamic between, innate and learned factors in language acquisition.},

Females had increased grey matter volume adjacent to the depths of both central sulci and the left superior temporal sulcus, in right Heschl's gyrus and PT, in right inferior frontal and frontomarginal gyri and in the cingulate gyrus. Females had significantly increased grey matter concentration extensively and relatively symmetrically in the cortical mantle, parahippocampal gyri, and in the banks of the cingulate and calcarine sulci.

  abstract = {Within linguistic theory, many phenomena that were previously handled by a separate grammatical component have been moved into the lexicon; in some theories, the contrast between grammar and the lexicon has disappeared altogether. In a review of findings from language development, language breakdown and real-time processing, we conclude that the case for a modular distinction between grammar and the lexicon has been overstated, and that the evidence to date is compatible with a unified lexicalist account. Studies of normal children show that the emergence of grammar is highly dependent upon vocabulary size, a finding confirmed and extended in atypical populations. Studies of language breakdown in older children and adults provide no evidence for a modular dissociation between grammar and the lexicon; some structures are especially vulnerable to brain damage (e.g. function words, non-canonical word orders), but this vulnerability is also observed in neurologically intact individuals under perceptual degradation or cognitive overload. Finally, on-line studies provide evidence for early and intricate interactions between lexical and grammatical information in normal adults. A possible characterization of this unified lexical processor is offered, based on distributed representations in recurrent neural networks.},

Overall, morphological instruction showed a significant improvement on literacy achievement (𝑑⎯⎯⎯d¯ \textbackslash overline d = 0.33).

Morphological instruction was particularly effective for children with reading, learning, or speech and language disabilities, English language learners, and struggling readers, suggesting the possibility that morphological instruction can remediate phonological processing challenges. Other moderators were also explored to explain differences in morphological intervention effects.

Results also suggested differences in effectiveness related to age and research design but not unit of intervention, scope, length, and learner type. Effect sizes decrease by school level (e.g., greater for younger students than middle school and upper elementary students).

  abstract = {Most brain related databases bring together specialized information, with a growing number that include neuroimaging measures. This article outlines the potential use and insights from the first entirely standardized and centralized database, which integrates information from neuroimaging measures (EEG, event related potential (ERP), structural/functional MRI), arousal (skin conductance responses (SCR)s, heart rate, respiration), neuropsychological and personality tests, genomics and demographics: The Brain Resource International Database. It comprises data from over 2,000 “normative” subjects and a growing number of patients with neurological and psychiatric illnesses, acquired from over 50 laboratories (in the USA, United Kingdom, Holland, South Africa, Israel and Australia), all with identical equipment and experimental procedures. Three primary goals of this database are to quantify individual differences in normative brain function, to compare an individual's performance to their database peers, and to provide a robust normative framework for clinical assessment and treatment prediction. We present three example demonstrations in relation to these goals. First, we show how consistent age differences may be quantified when large subject numbers are available, using EEG and ERP data from nearly 2,000 stringently screened normative subjects. Second, the use of a normalization technique provides a means to compare clinical subjects (50 ADHD subjects in this study) to the normative database with the effects of age and gender taken into account. Third, we show how a profile of EEG/ERP and autonomic measures potentially provides a means to predict treatment response in ADHD subjects. The example data consists of EEG under eyes open and eyes closed and ERP data for auditory oddball, working memory and Go-NoGo paradigms. Autonomic measures of skin conductance (tonic skin conductance level, SCL, and phasic skin conductance responses, SCRs) were acquired simultaneously with central EEG/ERP measures. The findings show that the power of large samples, tested using standardized protocols, allows for the quantification of individual differences that can subsequently be used to control such variation and to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of comparisons between normative and clinical groups. In terms of broader significance, the combination of size and multidimensional measures tapping the brain's core cognitive competencies, may provide a normative and evidence-based framework for individually-based assessments in “Personalized Medicine.”},

It states that each utterance in a coherent discourse segment contains a single semantic entity—the backward-looking center—that provides a link to the previous utterance, and an ordered set of entities—the forward-looking centers—that offer potential links to the next utterance. We report five reading-time experiments that test predictions of this theory with respect to the conditions under which it is preferable to realize (refer to) on entity using a pronoun rather thon o repeated definite description or name. The experiments show that there is a single backward-looking center that is preferentially realized as a pronoun, and that the backward-looking center is typically realized as the grammatical subject of the utterance. They also provide evidence that there is a set of forward-looking centers that is ranked in terms of prominence, and that a key factor in determining prominence—surface-initial position—does not affect determination of the backward-looking center. This provides evidence for the dissociation of the coherence processes of looking backward and looking forward.},

  abstract = {This study tests the hypothesis that second language (L2) learners move developmentally from decomposition of inflected words with less complex stem allomorphy to words with more complex stem allomorphy in lexical access. Robust auditory priming effects were observed for three types of Russian high- and low-frequency inflected verbs with graded regularity treated as complexity and productivity in stem allomorphy in native speakers (NS) of Russian. Similar effects were found in American L2 learners of Russian at three proficiency levels for high-frequency verbs. Low-frequency verbs showed an interaction of the degree of regularity with proficiency level, with priming effects present for regular verbs at all three proficiency levels, semi-regular verbs at two higher levels, and irregular verbs only at the highest level. Lemma and surface frequency effects were observed in irregular verbs only in L2 learners. Results suggest that in Russian, a highly inflected language, auditory lexical access occurs in two stages: first, decomposition into stem and inflectional affix, and second, access of the stem representation at the lemma level, which can occur directly or by further decomposing the stem into root and suffix (the nesting doll pattern). The first stage takes place automatically both in NS and L2 learners for all productive inflections, while the second is gradually acquired by late learners, from productive and less complex to unproductive and more complex stem allomorphy. This developmental tendency is in contrast to the claims that late second language learners store and access regularly inflected words undecomposed and supports the view that L2 learners beyond low proficiency levels process inflectional morphology.},

  abstract = {There is little agreement on the mechanisms involved in second language (L2) processing of regular and irregular inflectional morphology and on the exact role of age, amount, and type of exposure to L2 resulting in differences in L2 input and use. The article contributes to the ongoing debates by reporting the results of two experiments on Russian verb generation and recognition in a lexical decision task (LDT) with priming by highly proficient late L2 learners, early interrupted (heritage) learners, and adult native speakers of Russian. Inflected verbs varying in regularity, type, and token (lemma) frequency were used. The experiments document the role of obligatory decomposition and complex allomorphy involved in (de)composition and mapping as well as type and token frequency in L1 and L2 verb generation and lexical access, with no sharp division between regular and irregular verbs. The results are inconsistent with either the dual-system or the single-system approach to morphological processing, and are compatible with “hybrid” theories combining rule-based decomposition and input-frequency-based probabilistic mechanisms. All of the verb types showed priming effects, both in native and nonnative lexical access. However, the degree of facilitation depended on decomposition costs for different verb types only in nonnative participants. The study also shows differences in early (heritage) and late L2 learners. In the production task, heritage speakers outperformed L2 learners in real, but not novel, verb generation and in the use of the regular default pattern, whereas L2 learners showed an advantage in the use of the cue-based complex morphological pattern. In the priming task, heritage speakers were faster than late L2 learners and insensitive to morphological complexity, whereas L2 learners showed longer latencies in response to the verbs with complex inflectional morphology. These differences are associated with the differences in their respective language learning backgrounds. It is tentatively suggested that these two groups of learners may rely on different processing mechanisms and, possibly, neural paths.

  abstract = {Background: Neuroimaging offers unique opportunities for understanding the acquisition of reading by children and for unravelling the mystery of developmental dyslexia. Here, I provide a selective overview of recent neuroimaging studies, drawing out implications for education and the teaching of reading. Purpose: The different neuroimaging technologies available offer complementary techniques for revealing the biological basis of reading and dyslexia. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is most suited to localisation of function, and hence to investigating the neural networks that underpin efficient (or inefficient) reading. Electroencephalography (EEG) is sensitive to millisecond differences in timing, hence it is suited to studying the time course of processing; for example, it can reveal when networks relevant to phonology versus semantics are activated. Magnetic source imaging (MSI) gives information about both location in the brain and the time course of activation. I illustrate how each technology is most suited to answering particular questions about the core neural systems for reading, and how these systems interact, and what might go wrong in the dyslexic brain. Design and methods: Following a brief overview of behavioural studies of reading acquisition in different languages, selected neuroimaging studies of typical development are discussed and analysed. Those studies including the widest age ranges of children have been selected. Neuroimaging studies of developmental dyslexia are then reviewed, focusing on (a) the neural networks recruited for reading, (b) the time course of neural activation and (c) the neural effects of remediation. Representative studies using the different methodologies are selected. It is shown that studies converge in showing that the dyslexic brain is characterised by under-activation of the key neural networks for reading. Conclusions: Different neuroimaging methods can contribute different kinds of data relevant to key questions in education. The most informative studies with respect to causation will be longitudinal prospective studies, which are currently rare.},

  abstract = {The P600 is an event-related brain potential (ERP) typically associated with the processing of grammatical anomalies or incongruities. A similar response has also been observed in fully acceptable long-distance wh-dependencies. Such findings raise the question of whether these ERP responses reflect common underlying processes, and what might be the specific mechanisms that are shared between successful processing of well-formed sentences and the detection and repair of syntactic anomalies. The current study presents a comparison of the ERP responses elicited by syntactic violations, garden path sentences, and long-distance wh-dependencies, using maximally similar materials in a within-subjects design. Results showed that a P600 component was elicited by syntactic violations and garden path sentences, but was less robustly elicited in the long-distance wh-dependency condition. Differences in the scalp topography, onset and duration of the P600 effects are characterised in terms of the syntactic operations involved in building complex syntactic structures, with particular attention to retrieval processes, which control the latency of the P600, and structure building processes, which control its duration and amplitude.},

  abstract = {Current evidence suggests that morphologically complex words (e.g., farmer) are automatically segmented into their constituent morphemes (farm+er) during reading, a process referred to as “morpho-orthographic segmentation.”~Intriguingly, the evidence also suggests that this segmentation process even operates on words with a pseudo-morphological structure (e.g., corner: corn+er). Here we describe an account of morpho-orthographic segmentation for derivational morphology in non-agglutinative Latinate languages that underlines the key role played by edge-aligned embedded word activation. According to this account, affixes play a secondary role in the segmentation process, helping segmentation during the early processing of complex words only when embedded word activation is hindered. This provides a mechanism for initiating morpho-orthographic segmentation without appealing to specialized morphological representations. Use of edge-aligned embedded word activation is also thought to be the starting point of morpho-orthographic processing during reading development, such that efficient processing of embedded stems developmentally precedes processing of affixes as orthographic entities. Furthermore, it is the hypothesized delayed learning of orthographic representations for bound morphemes (morphemes that are not free-standing words), such as affixes, that accounts for the developmental trajectory of morpho-orthographic priming effects and the overall influence of morphological structure on processing morphologically complex stimuli. Our account of morpho-orthographic segmentation explains both the standard pattern of masked priming effects found with truly complex (e.g., farmer) and pseudo-complex (e.g., corner) words, as well as the pattern of priming effects obtained with complex nonword primes (e.g., farmage, cornity).},

  abstract = {In the present theoretical note we examine how different learning constraints, thought to be involved in optimizing the mapping of print to meaning during reading acquisition, might shape the nature of the orthographic code involved in skilled reading. On the one hand, optimization is hypothesized to involve selecting combinations of letters that are the most informative with respect to word identity (diagnosticity constraint), and on the other hand to involve the detection of letter combinations that correspond to pre-existing sublexical phonological and morphological representations (chunking constraint). These two constraints give rise to two different kinds of prelexical orthographic code, a coarse-grained and a fine-grained code, associated with the two routes of a dual-route architecture. Processing along the coarse-grained route optimizes fast access to semantics by using minimal subsets of letters that maximize information with respect to word identity, while coding for approximate within-word letter position independently of letter contiguity. Processing along the fined-grained route, on the other hand, is sensitive to the precise ordering of letters, as well as to position with respect to word beginnings and endings. This enables the chunking of frequently co-occurring contiguous letter combinations that form relevant units for morpho-orthographic processing (prefixes and suffixes) and for the sublexical translation of print to sound (multi-letter graphemes).},

Three mechanisms were identified that predict distinct facilitatory or inhibitory effects of each variable. The lexical competition account predicts overall inhibitory effects of neighbourhood density. The global activation (familiarity) account predicts overall facilitatory effects of neighbourhood density. Finally, the cross-code consistency account predicts an interaction, with inhibition of phonological neighbours in sparse orthographic regions and facilitation of phonological neighbours in dense orthographic regions. In Experiment 1 (lexical decision), a cross-over interaction was indeed found, supporting the prediction of the cross-code consistency account. In Experiment 2, this cross-over interaction was exaggerated by adding pseudohomo-phone stimuli (e.g., brane) among the nonword targets. Finally, in Experiment 3 (progressive demasking), we tried to shift the balance between inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms by using a perceptual identification task. As predicted, the inhibitory effects of phonological neighbourhood were amplified, whereas the facilitatory effects disappeared. We conclude that the level of compatibility across co-activated orthographic and phonological representations is a major causal factor underlying this pattern of effects.},

The model predicts distinct developmental trajectories for pseudo-homophone and transposed-letter effects – two benchmark phenomena associated with phonological recoding and coarse-grained orthographic processing, respectively. Pseudo-homophone effects should decrease over the first years of reading acquisition, whereas transposed-letter effects should initially increase. These predictions were tested in a lexical decision task with 334 children in grades 1–5, and 29 skilled adult readers. In line with the predictions, we found that the pseudo-homophone effect diminished as reading level increased, whereas the transposed-letter effect first increased and then diminished.},

Also, in Exp 1, word frequency continued to affect response times and error rate when NF was controlled. Results support activation-based accounts of the word recognition process.

Computational mechanisms for orthographic processing and orthography-tophonology translation are described. Two types of orthographic code are defined: a coarse code used to rapidly access semantic information during silent reading, and a finer-grained code used to access phonology from orthography. Furthermore, two types of phonological code are distinguished: one that is required for silent reading, and one that is required for reading aloud (articulation). The proposed architecture was initially constrained by behavioral data and purely computational considerations. The present chapter summarizes this work and describes recent research using electrophysiological recording of brain activity to further constrain the theory.}

  abstract = {Monkey See, Monkey Read An orthographic object such as a set of letters, and the ability to recognize such sets as words, is a key component of reading. The ability to develop these skills has often been attributed to the prior acquisition of a complex language. For example, we learn how letters sound and thus recognize when a particular letter makes up part of a word. However, orthographic processing is also a visual process, because we learn to recognize words as discrete objects, and the ability to read may thus be related to an ability to recognize and classify objects. Grainger et al. (p. 245; see the Perspective by Platt and Adams) tested orthographic skills in baboons. Captive, but freely ranging, baboons were trained to distinguish real English words from combinations of similar letters that are not words, and they were able to distinguish real words with remarkable accuracy. Thus, a basic ability to recognize words as objects does not require complex linguistic understanding. Skilled readers use information about which letters are where in a word (orthographic information) in order to access the sounds and meanings of printed words. We asked whether efficient processing of orthographic information could be achieved in the absence of prior language knowledge. To do so, we trained baboons to discriminate English words from nonsense combinations of letters that resembled real words. The results revealed that the baboons were using orthographic information in order to efficiently discriminate words from letter strings that were not words. Our results demonstrate that basic orthographic processing skills can be acquired in the absence of preexisting linguistic representations. Baboons discriminate words from nonwords on the basis of spelling. Baboons discriminate words from nonwords on the basis of spelling.},

The present conclusion--that attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes have important implicit modes of operation--extends both the construct validity and predictive usefulness of these major theoretical constructs of social psychology. Methodologically, this review calls for increased use of indirect measures--which are imperative in studies of implicit cognition. The theorized ordinariness of implicit stereotyping is consistent with recent findings of discrimination by people who explicitly disavow prejudice. The finding that implicit cognitive effects are often reduced by focusing judges' attention on their judgment task provides a basis for evaluating applications (such as affirmative action) aimed at reducing such unintended discrimination.},

  abstract = {A new view of the functional role of the left anterior cortex in language use is proposed. The experimental record indicates that most human linguistic abilities are not localized in this region. In particular, most of syntax (long thought to be there) is not located in Broca's area and its vicinity (operculum, insula, and subjacent white matter). This cerebral region, implicated in Broca's aphasia, does have a role in syntactic processing, but a highly specific one: It is the neural home to receptive mechanisms involved in the computation of the relation between transformationally moved phrasal constituents and their extraction sites (in line with the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis). It is also involved in the construction of higher parts of the syntactic tree in speech production. By contrast, basic combinatorial capacities necessary for language processing – for example, structure-building operations, lexical insertion – are not supported by the neural tissue of this cerebral region, nor is lexical or combinatorial semantics. The dense body of empirical evidence supporting this restrictive view comes mainly from several angles on lesion studies of syntax in agrammatic Broca's aphasia. Five empirical arguments are presented: experiments in sentence comprehension, cross-linguistic considerations (where aphasia findings from several language types are pooled and scrutinized comparatively), grammaticality and plausibility judgments, real-time processing of complex sentences, and rehabilitation. Also discussed are recent results from functional neuroimaging and from structured observations on speech production of Broca's aphasics. Syntactic abilities are nonetheless distinct from other cognitive skills and are represented entirely and exclusively in the left cerebral hemisphere. Although more widespread in the left hemisphere than previously thought, they are clearly distinct from other human combinatorial and intellectual abilities. The neurological record (based on functional imaging, split-brain and right-hemisphere-damaged patients, as well as patients suffering from a breakdown of mathematical skills) indicates that language is a distinct, modularly organized neurological entity. Combinatorial aspects of the language faculty reside in the human left cerebral hemisphere, but only the transformational component (or algorithms that implement it in use) is located in and around Broca's area.}

  abstract = {In three experiments we looked at the processing of interlexical homographs by Dutch-English bilinguals. In Experiment 1 we employed the translation recognition task, a task that forces the participants to activate both language systems simultaneously. In this task the processing of interlexical homographs was inhibited substantially compared to the processing of matched control words, especially when the homograph reading to be selected was the less frequent of the homograph's two readings. In Experiments 2 and 3 we used the lexical decision task: In one condition we asked the participants to categorize letter strings as words or nonwords in Dutch; in a second condition we asked them to do so in English. The makeup of the stimulus set in Experiment 2 permitted the participants to ignore the instructions and to instantiate the task in a language-neutral form-that is, to categorize the letter strings as words in either Dutch or English. Under these circumstances a small, frequency-dependent inhibitory effect for homographs was obtained, but only in condition Dutch. In Experiment 3 the participants were forced in a language-specific processing mode by the inclusion of "nonwords" that were in fact words in the non-target language. Large frequency-dependent inhibitory effects for homographs were now obtained in both language conditions. The combined results are interpreted as support for the view that bilingual lexical access is non-selective.},

  abstract = {How do speakers predict the syntax of a verb from its meaning? Traditional theories posit that syntactically relevant information about semantic arguments consists of a list of thematic roles like “agent”, “theme”, and “goal”, which are linked onto a hierarchy of grammatical positions like subject, object and oblique object. For verbs involving motion, the entity caused to move is defined as the “theme” or “patient” and linked to the object. However, this fails for many common verbs, as in ∗fill water into the glass and ∗cover a sheet onto the bed. In more recent theories verbs' meanings are multidimensional structures in which the motions, changes, and other events can be represented in separate but connected substructures; linking rules are sensitive to the position of an argument in a particular configuration. The verbs' object would be linked not to the moving entity but to the argument specified as “affected” or caused to change as the main event in the verbs' meaning. The change can either be one of location, resulting from motion in a particular manner, or of state, resulting from accomodating or reacting to a substance. For example, pour specifies how a substance moves (downward in a stream), so its substance argument is the object (pour the water/∗glass); fill specifies how a container changes (from not full to full), so its stationary container argument is the object (fill the glass/∗water). The newer theory was tested in three experiments. Children aged 3;4–9;4 and adults were taught made-up verbs, presented in a neutral syntactic context (this is mooping), referring to a transfer of items to a surface or container. Subjects were tested on their willingness to encode the moving items or the surface as the verb's object. For verbs where the items moved in a particular manner (e. g., zig-zagging), people were more likely to express the moving items as the object; for verbs where the surface changed state (e. g., shape, color, or fullness), people were more likely to express the surface as the object. This confirms that speakers are not confined to labeling moving entities as “themes” or “patients” and linking them to the grammatical object; when a stationary entity undergoes a state change as the result of a motion, it can be represented as the main affected argument and thereby linked to the grammatical object instead.},

Two event-related potential effects were observed in all age groups; however the 2 effects showed different developmental timecourses. The frontal asymmetry was correlated with reading and spelling scores, even after controlling for age. The distribution and onset of the more posterior rhyming effect were stable across age groups, suggesting that phonological matching relied on similar neural systems across these ages. Behaviorally, both reaction times and accuracy improved with age.

Yet limited research has investigated different forms of statistical learning within modality. This paper explores whether there is one unified statistical learning mechanism within the visual modality, or separate task-specific abilities. To do so, we examined individual differences in spatial and nonspatial conditional and distributional statistical learning. Participants completed four visual statistical learning tasks: conditional spatial, conditional nonspatial, distributional spatial, and distributional nonspatial. Performance on all four tasks significantly correlated with each other, and performance on all tasks accounted for a large portion of the variance across tasks (57\%). Interestingly, a portion of the variance of task performance (between 11\% and 18\%) was also accounted for by performance on each of the individual tasks. Our results suggest that visual statistical learning is the result of the interplay between a unified mechanism for extracting conditional and distributional statistical regularities across time and space, and an individual’s ability to extract specific types of regularities.},

We quantitatively show that there indeed exists an explicit gradient for feature complexity in the ventral pathway of the human brain. This was achieved by mapping thousands of stimulus features of increasing complexity across the cortical sheet using a deep neural network. Our approach also revealed a fine-grained functional specialization of downstream areas of the ventral stream. Furthermore, it allowed decoding of representations from human brain activity at an unsurpassed degree of accuracy, confirming the quality of the developed approach. Stimulus features that successfully explained neural responses indicate that population receptive fields were explicitly tuned for object categorization. This provides strong support for the hypothesis that object categorization is a guiding principle in the functional organization of the primate ventral stream.},

In addition, both surveyed groups preferred OneNote over a scientifically designed ELN (PerkinElmer Elements).

We hypothesized that individuals perform poorly on the RAT when they are biased to consider high-frequency candidate answers. To assess this hypothesis, we tested individuals with 48 RAT questions and required speeded responding to encourage guessing. Results supported our hypothesis. We generated a norm-based model of the RAT using a high-dimensional semantic space, and this model accurately identified correct answers. A frequency-biased model that included different levels of bias for high-frequency candidate answers explained variance for both correct and incorrect responses. Providing new insight into the nature of creativity, the model explains why some RAT questions are more difficult than others, and why some people perform better than others on the RAT.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the effects of combined semantic and syntactic violations in relation to the effects of single semantic and single syntactic violations on language-related event-related brain potential (ERP) effects (N400 and P600/ SPS). Syntactic violations consisted of a mismatch in grammatical gender or number features of the definite article and the noun in sentence-internal or sentence-final noun phrases (NPs). Semantic violations consisted of semantically implausible adjective–noun combinations in the same NPs. Combined syntactic and semantic violations were a summation of these two respective violation types. ERPs were recorded while subjects read the sentences with the different types of violations and the correct control sentences. ERP effects were computed relative to ERPs elicited by the sentence-internal or sentence-final nouns. The size of the N400 effect to the semantic violation was increased by an additional syntactic violation (the syntactic boost). In contrast, the size of the P600/ SPS to the syntactic violation was not affected by an additional semantic violation. This suggests that in the absence of syntactic ambiguity, the assignment of syntactic structure is independent of semantic context. However, semantic integration is influenced by syntactic processing. In the sentence-final position, additional global processing consequences were obtained as a result of earlier violations in the sentence. The resulting increase in the N400 amplitude to sentence-final words was independent of the nature of the violation. A speeded anomaly detection task revealed that it takes substantially longer to detect semantic than syntactic anomalies. These results are discussed in relation to the latency and processing characteristics of the N400 and P600/SPS effects. Overall, the results reveal an asymmetry in the interplay between syntax and semantics during on-line sentence comprehension.},

Here we focus on the neurobiological infrastructure for syntactic and semantic unification. Unification is characterized by a high-speed temporal profile including both prediction and integration of retrieved lexical elements. A meta-analysis of numerous neuroimaging studies reveals a clear dorsal/ventral gradient in both left inferior frontal cortex and left posterior temporal cortex, with dorsal foci for syntactic processing and ventral foci for semantic processing. In addition to core areas for unification, further networks need to be recruited to realize language-driven communication to its full extent. One example is the theory of mind network, which allows listeners and readers to infer the intended message (speaker meaning) from the coded meaning of the linguistic utterance. This indicates that sensorimotor simulation cannot handle all of language processing.}

Subjects read individual sentences containing one of three different kinds of violations of the syntactic constraints of Dutch. The ERP results provide evidence for M electrophysiological response to syntactic processing that is qualitatively different from established ERP responses to semantic processing. We refer to this electro-physiological manifestation of parsing as the Syntactic Positive Shift (SPS). The SPS was observed in an experiment in which no task demands, other than to read the input, were imposed on the subjects. The pattern of responses to the different kinds of syntactic violations suggests that the SPS indicates the impossibility for the parser to assign the preferred structure to an incoming string of words, irrespective of the specific syntactic nature of this preferred structure. The implications of these findings for further research on parsing are discussed.},

On the dual-route account, inflectional morphology is universally subserved by a symbolic rule route which deals with regular inflection and an associative memory component which deals with irregular inflection. This contrasts with single-route connectionist systems. The authors of the present article seek to counter supposed evidence for the dual-route account through large-scale simulations as well as through experimental data. The authors argue that, in its current form, the dual-route account is incapable of generating experimental data provided by Marcus et al. as support.

Correlations with other scales provide initial evidence of convergent and discriminant validity: the Disgust Scale correlates moderately with Sensation Seeking (r= - 0.46) and with Fear of Death (r= 0.39), correlates weakly with Neuroticism (r = 0.23) and Psychoticism (r= - 0.25), and correlates negligibly with Self-Monitoring and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Extraversion and Lie scales.

Predictions tested were that there would be a difference in slope, a difference in the mean while controlling for slope, or both. The results showed large linear effects for level of education and for age of immigration, but a negligible amount of additional variance was accounted for when the parameters for difference in slope and difference in means were estimated. Thus, the pattern of decline in second-language acquisition failed to produce the discontinuity that is an essential hallmark of a critical period. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

The time resolution of the method is better than 1 ms and the spatial discrimination is, under favorable circumstances, 2-3 mm for sources in the cerebral cortex. In MEG studies, the weak 10 fT-1 pT magnetic fields produced by electric currents flowing in neurons are measured with multichannel SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) gradiometers. The sites in the cerebral cortex that are activated by a stimulus can be found from the detected magnetic-field distribution, provided that appropriate assumptions about the source render the solution of the inverse problem unique. Many interesting properties of the working human brain can be studied, including spontaneous activity and signal processing following external stimuli. For clinical purposes, determination of the locations of epileptic foci is of interest. The authors begin with a general introduction and a short discussion of the neural basis of MEG. The mathematical theory of the method is then explained in detail, followed by a thorough description of MEG instrumentation, data analysis, and practical construction of multi-SQUID devices. Finally, several MEG experiments performed in the authors' laboratory are described, covering studies of evoked responses and of spontaneous activity in both healthy and diseased brains.

In contrast to the classical method (CM) of peak latency determination using only two or three electrodes, multichannel recordings deal with data from twenty or more recording electrodes. We compared the GFPM and CM in evoked potential recordings. Sixty five subjects volunteered for 3 different response tasks. In a P3 oddball paradigm targets consisted of 2000 Hz tonebursts, nontargets of 1000 Hz tonebursts. Flash and Pattern Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) also were recorded. At peak GFPM latency we found steeper voltage gradients than at CM latency. Both N200 and P300 had a significantly different topography at latencies determined by GFPM than at latencies determined by CM. For VEP we did not find a significant difference between CM and GFPM. Our Data suggests that multichannel recording adds additional dimensions to EP measurements and that only GFPM leads to an unbiased data-reduction as it determinesone momentary map in time which has maximal field strength.},

  abstract = {People are excellent at identifying faces familiar to them, even from very low quality images, but are bad at recognizing, or even matching, unfamiliar faces. In this review we shall consider some of the factors that affect our abilities to match unfamiliar faces. Major differences in orientation (e.g. inversion) or greyscale information (e.g. negation) affect face processing dramatically, and such effects suggest that representations derived from unfamiliar faces are based on relatively low-level image descriptions. Consistent with this, even relatively minor differences in lighting and viewpoint create problems for human face matching, leading to potentially important problems for the use of images from security videos. The relationships between different parts of the face (its ‘configuration’) are as important to the impression created of an upright face as the local features themselves, suggesting further constraints on the representations derived from faces. We go on to consider the contribution of computer face-recognition systems to the understanding of the theory and the practical problems of face identification. Finally, we look to the future of research in this area that will incorporate motion and 3-D shape information.},

We use deep convolutional networks to emulate the primate's ventral visual stream and explore the recent finding that baboons can be trained to discriminate English words from nonwords [1]. The networks were exposed to the exact same sequence of stimuli and reinforcement signals as the baboons in the experiment, and learned to map real visual inputs (pixels) of letter strings onto binary word/nonword responses. We show that the networks' highest levels of representations were indeed sensitive to letter combinations as postulated in our previous research. The model also captured the key empirical findings, such as generalization to novel words, along with some intriguing inter-individual differences. The present work shows the merits of deep learning networks that can simulate the whole processing chain all the way from the visual input to the response while allowing researchers to analyze the complex representations that emerge during the learning process.},

  abstract = {Competitive Scrabble is an activity that involves extraordinary word recognition experience. We investigated whether that experience is associated with exceptional behavior in the laboratory in a classic visual word recognition paradigm: the lexical decision task (LDT). We used a version of the LDT that involved horizontal and vertical presentation and a concreteness manipulation. In Experiment 1, we presented this task to a group of undergraduates, as these participants are the typical sample in word recognition studies. In Experiment 2, we compared the performance of a group of competitive Scrabble players with a group of age-matched nonexpert control participants. The results of a series of cognitive assessments showed that the Scrabble players and control participants differed only in Scrabble-specific skills (e.g., anagramming). Scrabble expertise was associated with two specific effects (as compared to controls): vertical fluency (relatively less difficulty judging lexicality for words presented in the vertical orientation) and semantic deemphasis (smaller concreteness effects for word responses). These results suggest that visual word recognition is shaped by experience, and that with experience there are efficiencies to be had even in the adult word recognition system.},

In contrast to previous models, the present model uses an architecture in which meanings are jointly determined by the 2 components, with the division of labor between them affected by the nature of the mappings between codes. The model is consistent with a variety of behavioral phenomena, including the results of studies of homophones and pseudohomophones thought to support other theories, and illustrates how efficient processing can be achieved using multiple simultaneous constraints.},

Compared with simple feedforward networks, representing phonological knowledge in an attractor network yielded improved learning and generalization. Phonological and surface forms of developmental dyslexia, which are usually attributed to impairments in distinct lexical and nonlexical processing "routes," were derived from different types of damage to the network.

However, nonarguments in similar sentences fail to elicit the same response. For example, the reflexive in John's brothers like himself is in an argument position and elicits the P600 when compared with its grammatical counterpart. The nonargument, participating in the same type of mismatch, John's brothers like Bill and himself , does not elicit the same positivity. This provides evidence that there are 2 processes involved in parsing this binding construction, one syntactic and another as yet unidentified, perhaps involving meaning or pragmatics.

Children watched while animal characters were offered various types of container and then predicted their emotional reaction. In Experiment 1, the children (but not the characters) knew that the desirable contents of each container had been removed. The majority of 6-year-olds and a minority of 4-year-olds understood that the characters would be happy with the gift, given their mistaken belief about its contents. In Experiment 2, characters were given containers apparently containing an object they wanted but really containing an object they did not want, or vice versa. Predictions of emotion based on both the desire and the mistaken belief of the characters increased with age. In Experiment 3, characters were given closed containers that might or might not contain an item they wanted. Both 3-and 5-year-olds grasped that the characters' emotional reaction would depend on both their (unconfirmed) beliefs and desires about its content. The experiments show that preschool children deploy a theory-like conception of mind in predicting emotional reactions. They understand that the emotional impact of a situation depends not on its objective features but on the beliefs and desires that are brought to it.},

Moreover, developing readers are sensitive to the morphological structure of words (TEACH-ER). However, the interaction between orthographic and morphological processes in meaning activation during reading is not well established. What determines semantic access to orthographically embedded words? What is the role of suffixes in this process? And how does this change throughout development? To address these questions, we asked 80 Italian elementary school children (third, fourth, and fifth grade) to make category decisions on words (e.g., is CARROT a type of food?). Critically, some target words for no-answers (e.g., is CORNER a type of food?) contained category-congruent embedded stems (i.e., CORN). To gauge the role of morphology in this process, half of the embedded stems were accompanied by a pseudosuffix (CORN-ER) and half by a non-morphological ending (PEA-CE). Results revealed that words were harder to reject as members of a category when the embedded stem was category-congruent. This effect held both with and without a pseudosuffix, but was larger for pseudosuffixed words in the error rates. These results suggest that orthographic stems are activated and activation is fed forward to the semantic level regardless of morphological structure, followed by a decision-making process that might strategically use suffix-like endings.},

  abstract = {In visual word identification, readers automatically access word internal information: they recognize orthographically embedded words (e.g., HAT in THAT) and are sensitive to morphological structure (DEAL–ER, BASKET–BALL). The exact mechanisms that govern these processes, however, are not well established yet – how is this information used? What is the role of affixes in this process? To address these questions, we tested the activation of meaning of embedded word stems in the presence or absence of a morphological structure using two semantic categorization tasks in Italian. Participants made category decisions on words (e.g., is CARROT a type of food?). Some no-answers (is CORNER a type of food?) contained category-congruent embedded word stems (i.e., CORN–). Moreover, the embedded stems could be accompanied by a pseudo-suffix (-er in CORNER) or a non-morphological ending (-ce in PEACE) – this allowed gauging the role of pseudo-suffixes in stem activation. The analyses of accuracy and response times revealed that words were harder to reject as members of a category when they contained an embedded word stem that was indeed category-congruent. Critically, this was the case regardless of the presence or absence of a pseudo-suffix. These findings provide evidence that the lexical identification system activates the meaning of embedded word stems when the task requires semantic information. This study brings together research on orthographic neighbors and morphological processing, yielding results that have important implications for models of visual word processing.},

  abstract = {Suffixes have been shown to be recognized as units of processing in visual word recognition and their identification has been argued to be position-specific in skilled adult readers: in lexical decision tasks suffixes are automatically identified at word endings, but not at word beginnings. The present study set out to investigate whether position-specific coding can be detected with a letter search task and whether children already code suffixes as position-specific units. A preregistered experiment was conducted in Italian in which 3rd-graders, 5th-graders, and adults had to detect a target letter that was either contained in the suffix of a pseudoword (e.g., S in flagish) or in a non-suffix control (e.g., S in flagosh). To investigate sensitivity to position, letters also had to be detected in suffixes and non-suffixes placed in reversed position, that is in the beginning of pseudowords (e.g., S in ishflag vs. oshflag). Results suggested position-specific processing differences between suffixes and non-suffixes that develop throughout reading development. However, some effects were weak and only partially compatible with the hypotheses. Therefore, a second experiment was conducted. The effects of position-specific suffix identification could not be replicated. A combined analysis additionally using a Bayesian approach indicated no processing differences between suffixes and non-suffixes in our task. We discuss potential interpretations and the possibility of letter search being unsuited to investigate morpheme processing. We connect our example of failed self-replication to the current discussion about the replication crisis in psychology and the lesson psycholinguistics can learn.},

However, its development is poorly understood. We addressed this issue by taking a longitudinal approach that allows greater rigor in establishing the relationship between grade, reading skill, and morphological priming. A masked priming lexical decision task with suffixed words (kleidchen-KLEID), suffixed nonwords (kleidtum-KLEID), non-suffixed nonwords (kleidekt-KLEID) and unrelated primes (träumerei-KLEID) was administered to 98 children in grade 2, and again in grade 3 and 4 of elementary school. Reading skill was measured at each testing point. Grade and reading skill were associated with distinct patterns of priming: all priming effects increased with reading skill, whereas priming from non-suffixed nonwords decreased with grade. This suggests that the ability to identify stems can be associated with reading skills, while sensitivity to affixes is acquired over grades.},

This paper questions the methodology used in this research and uses a novel approach to examine the unique contribution of language to categorisation behaviour. Results of three investigations are reported. The first required development of objective measures of category coherence and consistency to clarify questions about healthy control performance on the freesorting colour categorisation task used in previous studies. Between-participant consistency was found to be only moderate and the number of colour categories generated was found to vary markedly between individuals. The second study involved longitudinal neuropsychological examination of a patient whose colour categorisation strategy was monitored in the context of a progressive decline in language due to semantic dementia. Performance on measures of category coherence and consistency was found to be relatively stable over time despite a profound decline in the patient's colour language. In a final investigation we demonstrated that, for both the patient and controls, between- and within-participant consistency were higher than expected by (a) random sorting and (b) sorting perceptually similar chips together. These findings indicate that the maintenance of colour categorisation need not depend on language. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

However, this previous investigation was unable to separate the putative word category effects from possible influences of the direction of acoustic change on the MMN response. The present study disentangled these two effects by comparing the effects of the direction of acoustic change within and isolated from the lexical context that had previously been used to create the word-category contrast. Although the direction of acoustic change exerted a significant influence on the MMN amplitude, some of the temporal and topographic characteristics of the MMN and the overall pattern of the deviance-related ERP response proved to be specific to word-category effects. These findings provide the first reliable evidence that the MMN can serve as an index of word-category-specific processing and support the notion of early processing and representational differences between verbs and nouns.},

However, recent studies have challenged this position by reporting highly automatic ERP effects for morphosyntax in the 100 to 200 msec time range. The present study aimed at determining the factors that could contribute to such shifts in latency and automaticity. In two experiments varying the degree of attention, German phrase structure and morphosyntactic violations were compared in conditions in which the locality of the violated syntactic relation, as well as the violation point and the acoustic properties of the speech stimuli, were strictly controlled for. A negativity between 100 and 300 msec after the violation point occurred in response to both types of syntactic violations and independently of the allocation of attentional resources. These findings suggest that the timing and automaticity of ERP effects reflecting specific syntactic subprocesses are influenced to a larger degree by methodological than by linguistic factors, and thus, need to be regarded as relative rather than fixed to temporally successive processing stages.},

In most usages the term “language” is superordinate to “dialed,” but the nature of this relationship may be either linguistic or social, the latter problem falling in the province of sociolinguistics. It is shown how the development of a vernacular, popularly called a dialect, into a language is intimately related to the development of writing and the growth of nationalism.

This served two goals, namely (I) to clarify their possible effects as confounds in ERP experiments employing word-stimuli, and (II) to determine the point in time of lexical access in visual word recognition. Methods: EEG was recorded from 64 scalp sites while subjects (n=12) performed a lexical decision task. Word length and frequency were orthogonally varied between stimulus groups, whereas variables including regularity of spelling and orthographic tri-gram frequency were kept constant. Results: Long words produced the strongest brain response early on (∼100 ms after stimulus onset), whereas those to short words became strongest later (150–360 ms). Lower ERP amplitudes were elicited by words with high frequency compared with low frequency words in the latency ranges 150–190 ms and 320–360 ms. However, we did not find evidence for a robust alteration of peak latencies with word frequency. Conclusions: Length and frequency of word stimuli have independent and additive effects on the amplitude of the ERP. Studies on the precise time course of cognitive processes should consider their potentially confounding character. Our data support the view that lexical access takes place as early as 150 ms after onset of written word stimuli.},

Different domains of research have still not converged on a coherent account. An integration of multiple sources of information would lead to more strongly constrained theoretical models, and help finding optimal measures when monitoring specific aspects of word recognition impairments in patient groups. In our multimodal approach--combining fast behavioral measures, ERPs and EEG/MEG source estimation--we provide converging evidence for the latencies of earliest lexical and semantic information retrieval in visual word recognition. Participants performed lexical and semantic decisions (LD, SD) in a Go/NoGo paradigm. We introduced eye-blink latencies as a dependent variable, in order to measure behavioral responses that are faster and less variable than traditional button presses. We found that the earliest behavioral responses distinguishing stimulus categories can occur around 310 ms. Ex-Gaussian analysis of behavioral responses did not reveal reliable differences between LD and SD. The earliest ERP differences between Go and NoGo conditions occurred around 160 ms for both LD and SD. Distributed source analysis of combined EEG/MEG data estimated neuronal generators for the lexicality effect around 200 ms in the left anterior middle temporal lobe. Thus, behavior and brain responses provide coherent evidence that the brain starts retrieving lexical and semantic information near-simultaneously within 200 ms of word onset. Our results support models of word recognition that assume a continuous accumulation of task-related information from the stimulus, which might be described by Bayesian principles.},

Neurophysiological responses recorded in a visual lexical decision task were submitted to linear regression analysis. First, 10 psycholinguistic features of each of 300 stimulus words were submitted to a principal component analysis, which yielded four orthogonal variables likely to reflect separable processes in visual word recognition: Word length, Letter n-gram frequency, Lexical frequency and Semantic coherence of a word's morphological family. Since the lexical decision task required subjects to distinguish between words and pseudowords, the binary variable Lexicality was also investigated using a factorial design. Word–pseudoword differences in the event-related potential first appeared at 160 ms after word onset. However, regression analysis of EEG data documented a much earlier effect of both Word length and Letter n-gram frequency around 90 ms. Lexical frequency showed its earliest effect slightly later, at 110 ms, and Semantic coherence significantly correlated with neurophysiological measures around 160 ms, simultaneously with the lexicality effect. Source estimates indicated parieto-temporo-occipital generators for the factors Length, Letter n-gram frequency and Word frequency, but widespread activation with foci in left anterior temporal lobe and inferior frontal cortex related to Semantic coherence. At later stages (\&gt;200 ms), all variables exhibited simultaneous EEG correlates. These results indicate that information about surface form and meaning of a lexical item is first accessed at different times in different brain systems and then processed simultaneously, thus supporting cascaded interactive processing models.},

FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

We show that, to date, (1) studies of nonhuman animals provide virtually no relevant parallels to human linguistic communication, and none to the underlying biological capacity; (2) the fossil and archaeological evidence does not inform our understanding of the computations and representations of our earliest ancestors, leaving details of origins and selective pressure unresolved; (3) our understanding of the genetics of language is so impoverished that there is little hope of connecting genes to linguistic processes any time soon; (4) all modeling attempts have made unfounded assumptions, and have provided no empirical tests, thus leaving any insights into language's origins unverifiable. Based on the current state of evidence, we submit that the most fundamental questions about the origins and evolution of our linguistic capacity remain as mysterious as ever, with considerable uncertainty about the discovery of either relevant or conclusive evidence that can adjudicate among the many open hypotheses.

Violations of derivational morphology elicited an increased N400 component plus a late positivity (P600), unlike gender-agreement violations, which produced the biphasic LAN/P600 ERP pattern known from previous studies of morpho-syntactic violations. We conclude that the recognition of derived word forms engages both word-level (lexical-semantic) and decompositional (morpheme-based) processes.

  abstract = {Morphology is an important part of language processing but little is known about how adult second language learners acquire morphological rules. Using a word-picture associative learning task, we have previously shown that a brief exposure to novel words with embedded morphological structure (suffix for natural gender) is enough for language learners to acquire the hidden morphological rule. Here we used this paradigm to study the brain signatures of early morphological learning in a novel language in adults. Behavioural measures indicated successful lexical (word stem) and morphological (gender suffix) learning. A day after the learning phase, event-related brain potentials registered during a recognition memory task revealed enhanced N400 and P600 components for stem and suffix violations, respectively. An additional effect observed with combined suffix and stem violations was an enhancement of an early N2 component, most probably related to conflict-detection processes. Successful morphological learning was also evident in the ERP responses to the subsequent rule-generalization task with new stems, where violation of the morphological rule was associated with an early (250–400ms) and late positivity (750–900ms). Overall, these findings tend to converge with lexical and morphosyntactic violation effects observed in L1 processing, suggesting that even after a short exposure, adult language learners can acquire both novel words and novel morphological rules.},

We propose a model for the organization of this system that emphasizes a distinction between the representation of invariant and changeable aspects of faces. The representation of invariant aspects of faces underlies the recognition of individuals, whereas the representation of changeable aspects of faces, such as eye gaze, expression, and lip movement, underlies the perception of information that facilitates social communication. The model is also hierarchical insofar as it is divided into a core system and an extended system. The core system is comprised of occipitotemporal regions in extrastriate visual cortex that mediate the visual analysis of faces. In the core system, the representation of invariant aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the fusiform gyrus, whereas the representation of changeable aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the superior temporal sulcus. The extended system is comprised of regions from neural systems for other cognitive functions that can be recruited to act in concert with the regions in the core system to extract meaning from faces.

Ss were presented with pairs of words and asked to provide intuitions about which member of the pair was more easily decomposable. The results show that Ss perceived derived forms that are more frequent than their bases to be significantly less complex than matched counterparts that are less frequent than their bases. Dictionary calculations reveal that derived forms that are more frequent than their bases are significantly more likely to display symptoms of semantic drift than derived forms containing higher-frequency bases. High-frequency forms, however, are no more prone to semantic drift than low-frequency forms. These results provide evidence that it is relative frequency, rather than absolute frequency, that affects the decomposability of morphologically complex words. A low-frequency form is likely to be nontransparent if it is composed of even lower-frequency parts. And a high-frequency form may be highly decomposable if the base word it contains is higher frequency still. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

We outline a growing body of evidence, mostly external to the above debate, indicating that morphological structure is indeed intrinsically graded.

This generalization holds both at the affix level and the word level. At the affix level, this maxim, when combined with an understanding of the role of frequency and phonotactics in morphological processing, can account for the patterns generally attributed to level ordering. At the word level, it can explain the so-called dual-level behavior of some affixes?anaffix may resist attaching to a complex word that is highly decomposable but be acceptable whenit attaches to a comparable complex word that favors the direct access route in speech perception. Only a parsing account can afford this set of phenomena a unified explanation.* INTRODUCTION. One of the most debated problems of English morphology is that of stacking restrictions amongst derivational affixes. Of the many potential combinations of affixes, only a very small proportion are actually attested. Many attempts to account for apparent restrictions on affix ordering have invoked some form of the AFFIX-ORDERING GENERALIZATION (Siegel 1979). The basic claim of the affix-ordering generalization is that affixes can be divided into two sets: level 1 and level 2. Level 1 affixation occurs prior to level 2 affixation, and so no level 1 affix can attach outside of any level 2 affix (hence *-ness-ic, *-less-ity,andsoon). I argue here that early accounts of affix ordering were overly restrictive and drew the line at the wrong level of abstraction. But more recent work, which has discarded the idea that there are any restrictions on ordering (beyond selectional restrictions), misses a number of important generalizations. Many facts about English stacking restrictions can be predicted if we reduce the problem to one of parsability. This can capture not only the range of generalizations about English stacking restrictions but also a large number of systematic, word-based exceptions to these generalizations. Inapaperwidelycitedasresponsiblefordisprovingtheaffix-orderinggeneralization, Fabb(1988)arguesagainstastratificationalapproachtoaffixordering.Hedemonstrates that the affix-ordering generalization fails to rule out a large number of affix combinations,whichnonethelessdonotoccur.Hearguesthataffixorderingisconstrainedonly by selectional restrictions: all but a few non-occurring pairs of suffixes can be ruled out solely by a combination of selectional restrictions, of which one of the most extensive in its effects is a restriction against attachment to an already suffixed word. (Fabb 1988:538) One of Fabb?s observations, then, is that there seem to be a large number of affixes that do not attach to already affixed words. This observation, I argue, holds the key to understanding restrictions on affix ordering in English. Many affixes are sensitive to internal structure in potential bases. While some affixes basically tolerate no internal structure,otherswilltoleratestructuretosomeminimumdegree.Thedegreeofinternal *Thisarticleisbasedonchapter9ofmyNorthwesternUniversitydissertation(Hay2000).Forcomments anddiscussionsI amgratefultoHarald Baayen,MaryBeckman,Andrew Carstairs-McCarthy,BrianJoseph, Chris Kennedy, Janet Pierrehumbert, Ingo Plag, Lance Rips, two anonymous referees, and audiences at NorthwesternUniversity, VictoriaUniversity ofWellington, andthe affixordering workshopat MaxPlanck Institute, Nijmegen. 527 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 78, NUMBER 3, (2002)528 structure tolerated by an affix is not determined by selectional restrictions, but, rather, by how much structure that affix itself creates.

  abstract = {There is a long-standing debate about the principles and mechanisms that constrain the combinatorial properties of affixes, in particular of English suffixes. One group of scholars argues for the existence of lexical strata with strong restrictions holding between the different strata. This view is disputed by scholars who claim that it is selectional restrictions of individual suffixes that are responsible for the combinatorial properties of suffixes. Most recently, Hay (2000, 2002) has proposed a psycholinguistic model of morphological complexity, according to which an affix which can be easily parsed out in processing should not occur inside an affix which cannot. This model has been called ``complexity based ordering''. The general claim is that affixes can be approximately ordered along a hierarchy of complexity, with more separable affixes at one end, and less separable affixes at the other end. More separable affixes can attach outside less separable affixes, but not vice-versa. The goal of this paper is to test the predictions of complexity based ordering through an investigation of 15 English suffixes and their potential 210 two-suffix combinations. Using large data-bases such as the British National Corpus, the CELEX lexical database, the OED and the internet, we investigate whether the attested and non-attested combinations are best explained by complexity based ordering or by the individual selectional properties of these suffixes. We show that in most cases selectional restrictions and parsing restrictions coincide. Where selectional restrictions underdetermine possible combinations, complexity based ordering makes correct predictions. Only easily parsable combinations are possible combinations, and this range of possible combinations is then further curtailed by selectional restrictions. In sum, we argue that both selectional restrictions and parsing constraints are instrumental in determining possible and impossible suffix combinations.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts are often unfruitful, even with the most well established tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of individual differences. Experimental effects become well established – and thus those tasks become popular – when between-subject variability is low. However, low between-subject variability causes low reliability for individual differences, destroying replicable correlations with other factors and potentially undermining published conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though these statistical issues have a long history in psychology, they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing, Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to .82, being surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As we predicted, this emerged from low variance between individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily replicable experimental effects – low between-participant variability – makes their use as correlational tools problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability estimates into account has the potential to qualitatively change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our findings are that well-established approaches in experimental psychology and neuropsychology may not directly translate to the study of individual differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function, and alternative metrics may be required.},

It begins by classifying different types of visual-spatial displays, followed by a discussion of ways in which visual-spatial displays augment cognition and an overview of the perceptual and cognitive processes involved in using displays. The paper then argues for the importance of cognitive science methods to the design of visual displays and reviews some of the main principles of display design that have emerged from these approaches to date. Cognitive scientists have had good success in characterizing the performance of well-defined tasks with relatively simple visual displays, but many challenges remain in understanding the use of complex displays for ill-defined tasks. Current research exemplified by the papers in this topic extends empirical approaches to new displays and domains, informs the development of general principles of graphic design, and addresses current challenges in display design raised by the recent explosion in availability of complex data sets and new technologies for visualizing and interacting with these data.},

I used 20 English-speaking female undergraduates and 10 foreign students to complete previous location of these focal colors on the dimensions of hue, value, and saturation. In Exp. II, 23 speakers of different languages named a sample of focal and nonfocal colors. In Exp. III, 20 English speakers and 21 New Guinea Dani, speakers of a language which lacks hue names, remembered and recognized focal and nonfocal colors. In Exp. IV, 19 Dani learned names for focal and nonfocal colors in a paired-associates task. Results show that focal colors (a) were given the shortest names and named most rapidly across languages, (b) were the most accurately recognized both by English and Dani speakers, and (c) could be paired with names with fewest errors. On the basis of these findings, linguistically causal interpretations of earlier language-cognition studies using color are challenged. (20 ref.)

Theses reactions are caused by design features, which operate either through their perceptual attributes or from a sense of control in handling or from past experience. A systematic framework is proposed to conceptualize Affective Human Factors Design or as we call it - Hedonomics. The word Hedonomics is derived from the Greek “hedone” (pleasure – akin to sweet) and “nomos” (laws, principles). The focus is on pleasurable design of artifacts and tasks. Several existing theories may combine to support this framework, including: Human Information Processing, Activity Theory, and Theory of Flow. There are also analogies with past theories – in human need structure, motivation, job satisfaction, and stress research. The problem is now to conceptualize Hedonomics, to propose theories that can be used for design, and appropriate measurement tools. It is particularly important to develop tools to measure and predict affective design – and on an individual level predict user and customer needs for affect.},

In this study, we hypothesized that a source of this gap is greater reliance on information about others’ behavior when deciding whether to take a risk oneself than when deciding whether to recommend it to others. To test this hypothesis, we asked participants either to report their willingness to engage in a series of risky behaviors themselves; their willingness to recommend those behaviors to a loved one; or, how good of an idea it would be for either them or a loved one to engage in the behaviors. We then asked them to evaluate those behaviors on criteria related to the expected utility of the risk (benefits, costs, and likelihood of costs), and on engagement in the activity by people they knew. We found that, after accounting for effects of perceived benefit, cost, and likelihood of cost, perceptions of others’ behavior had a dramatically larger impact on participants’ willingness to engage in a risk than on their willingness to recommend the risk or their prescriptive evaluation of the risk. These findings indicate that the influence of others’ choices on risk-taking behavior is large, direct, cannot be explained by an economic utility model of risky decision-making, and goes against one’s own better judgment.

Organisms use favourable seasons to reproduce and grow, and withdraw during unfavourable seasons. To deal with the predictable changes in their environments, all taxonomic groups have evolved genetically programmed timing mechanisms. These govern seasonal cycles in physiology and behaviour that optimise survival and reproductive success, and have been formally described as circannual rhythms. Experimentally, under conditions of constant day length and temperature, circannual rhythms of many species continue to be expressed, even throughout the life cycle, illustrating the fundamental endogenous control. Under natural conditions, they are usually entrained by seasonal time cues, notably photoperiod, to synchronise the biology to environmental periodicity. Here we review long-term timekeeping strategies from classical vertebrate models to invertebrate and unicell life histories. These circannual rhythms enable organisms to anticipate Earth’s periodicity.},

For word frequency, oscillations in the theta range emerged. By contrast, phrase frequency showed a persistent effect over time. Furthermore, independent effects with different temporal and topographical signatures characterized phrasal prototypicality. In a simulation study we demonstrate that naive discrimination learning provides an alternative account of the data that is as least as powerful as a standard lexical predictor analysis.

Despite much interest in STEAM it is often challenging for many teachers to integrate into their teaching of school subject matter. I suggest that as an interdisciplinary crossroads, design thinking provides a natural bridge between the arts, sciences, and other subjects. In this it can offer guiding flexible structure and in-road for teachers to design STEAM-based lessons, and to incorporate as an integrated aspect of students’ STEAM learning. I discuss an example of an elementary Spanish teacher, who, as a student in a graduate-level design thinking and education course, used design thinking to design an interdisciplinary STEAM project for her students. This example illustrates how design thinking can guide teachers’ STEAM curriculum design, and be interwoven into elements of STEAM curricula, to open up more interdisciplinary, creative and project-based opportunities.},

  abstract = {I argue here that functional neuroimaging data—which I restrict to the haemodynamic techniques of fMRI and PET—can inform psychological theorizing, provided one assumes a “systematic” function–structure mapping in the brain. In this case, imaging data simply comprise another dependent variable, along with behavioural data, that can be used to test competing theories. In particular, I distinguish two types of inference: function-to-structure deduction and structure-to-function induction. With the former inference, a qualitatively different pattern of activity over the brain under two experimental conditions implies at least one different function associated with changes in the independent variable. With the second type of inference, activity of the same brain region(s) under two conditions implies a common function, possibly not predicted a priori. I illustrate these inferences with imaging studies of recognition memory, short-term memory, and repetition priming. I then consider in greater detail what is meant by a “systematic” function–structure mapping and argue that, particularly for structure-to-function induction, this entails a one-to-one mapping between functional and structural units, although the structural unit may be a network of interacting regions and care must be taken over the appropriate level of functional/structural abstraction. Nonetheless, the assumption of a systematic function–structure mapping is a “working hypothesis” that, in common with other scientific fields, cannot be proved on independent grounds and is probably best evaluated by the success of the enterprise as a whole. I also consider statistical issues such as the definition of a qualitative difference and methodological issues such as the relationship between imaging and behavioural data. I finish by reviewing various objections to neuroimaging, including neophrenology, functionalism, and equipotentiality, and by observing some criticisms of current practice in the imaging literature.},

  abstract = {It is a widespread notion that the proportion of glial to neuronal cells in the brain increases with brain size, to the point that glial cells represent “about 90\% of all cells in the human brain.” This notion, however, is wrong on both counts: neither does the glia/neuron ratio increase uniformly with brain size, nor do glial cells represent the majority of cells in the human brain. This review examines the origin of interest in the glia/neuron ratio; the original evidence that led to the notion that it increases with brain size; the extent to which this concept can be applied to white matter and whole brains and the recent supporting evidence that the glia/neuron ratio does not increase with brain size, but rather, and in surprisingly uniform fashion, with decreasing neuronal density due to increasing average neuronal cell size, across brain structures and species. Variations in the glia/neuron ratio are proposed to be related not to the supposed larger metabolic cost of larger neurons (given that this cost is not found to vary with neuronal density), but simply to the large variation in neuronal sizes across brain structures and species in the face of less overall variation in glial cell sizes, with interesting implications for brain physiology. The emerging evidence that the glia/neuron ratio varies uniformly across the different brain structures of mammalian species that diverged as early as 90 million years ago in evolution highlights how fundamental for brain function must be the interaction between glial cells and neurons.

Three experiments investigated to what extent cross-language phonological co-activation effects in language production are sensitive to the composition of the stimulus list. L1 Dutch–L2 English bilinguals decided whether or not a particular phoneme was part of the L2 English name of the picture. The phoneme was either part of the English name of the picture (/b/ or /t/ in bottle), the Dutch name of the picture (/f/ in fles [bottle], the cross-language condition), or was not part of either the English or Dutch names of the picture (/p/, the unrelated condition). In Experiment 1, we added a set of filler pictures with noncognate names in Dutch and English. In contrast, the filler pictures in Experiment 2 all had cognate names in Dutch and English. In Experiment 3 the fillers consisted of a mixture of pictures with cognate (25\%) and noncognate (75\%) names. Cross-language phonological co-activation appeared sensitive to the composition of the stimulus list: Phonological co-activation effects were observed in Experiments 2 and 3, but not in Experiment 1.

The second basic question in the neuropsychology of bilingualism concerns the neural correlates of language switching, that is, the areas that are active when bilinguals switch from one language to the other. Performance between single-language and dual-language picture naming was compared in a group of six Spanish–English bilinguals using behavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants showed slower reaction times and increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the mixed language condition relative to single language condition. There was no evidence that each language was represented in different areas of the brain. Results are consistent with the view that language switching is a part of a general executive attentional system and that languages are represented in overlapping areas of the brain in early bilinguals.},

We tested this hypothesis by giving a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests to large numbers of two of humans' closest primate relatives, chimpanzees and orangutans, as well as to 2.5-year-old human children before literacy and schooling. Supporting the cultural intelligence hypothesis and contradicting the hypothesis that humans simply have more “general intelligence,” we found that the children and chimpanzees had very similar cognitive skills for dealing with the physical world but that the children had more sophisticated cognitive skills than either of the ape species for dealing with the social world.},

Some of these advances are summarized in this review. It will be argued that recognizing speech sounds is carried out in the superior temporal lobe bilaterally, that the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally is involved in phonological-level aspects of this process, that the frontal/motor system is not central to speech recognition although it may modulate auditory perception of speech, that conceptual access mechanisms are likely located in the lateral posterior temporal lobe (middle and inferior temporal gyri), that speech production involves sensory-related systems in the posterior superior temporal lobe in the left hemisphere, that the interface between perceptual and motor systems is supported by a sensory-motor circuit for vocal tract actions (not dedicated to speech) that is very similar to sensory-motor circuits found in primate parietal lobe, and that verbal short-term memory can be understood as an emergent property of this sensory-motor circuit. These observations are considered within the context of a dual stream model of speech processing in which one pathway supports speech comprehension and the other supports sensory-motor integration. Additional topics of discussion include the functional organization of the planum temporale for spatial hearing and speech-related sensory-motor processes, the anatomical and functional basis of a form of acquired language disorder, conduction aphasia, the neural basis of vocabulary development, and sentence-level/grammatical processing.},

Part of the difficulty, we suggest, stems from the fact that the neural systems supporting ‘speech perception’ vary as a function of the task. Specifically, the set of cognitive and neural systems involved in performing traditional laboratory speech perception tasks, such as syllable discrimination or identification, only partially overlap those involved in speech perception as it occurs during natural language comprehension. In this review, we argue that cortical fields in the posterior–superior temporal lobe, bilaterally, constitute the primary substrate for constructing sound-based representations of speech, and that these sound-based representations interface with different supramodal systems in a task-dependent manner. Tasks that require access to the mental lexicon (i.e. accessing meaning-based representations) rely on auditory-to-meaning interface systems in the cortex in the vicinity of the left temporal–parietal–occipital junction. Tasks that require explicit access to speech segments rely on auditory–motor interface systems in the left frontal and parietal lobes. This auditory–motor interface system also appears to be recruited in phonological working memory.},

This double dissociation within a single patient with respect to grammatical category provides evidence for the hypothesis that phonological and orthographic representations of nouns and verbs are processed by independent neural mechanisms. Furthermore, the opposite dissociation in the verbal output modality, an advantage for nouns over verbs in spoken tasks, by a different patient using the same stimuli has also been reported (Caramazza \& Hillis, 1991). This double dissociation across patients on the same task indicates that results cannot be ascribed to "greater difficulty" with one type of stimulus, and provides further evidence for the view that grammatical category information is an important organizational principle of lexical knowledge in the brain.},

With severe damage, a forced-choice decision between categories was possible even when the choice of the particular semantic vector within the category was not possible. The damaged networks typically exhibited many mixed visual and semantic errors in which the output corresponded to a word that was both visually and semantically similar. Surprisingly, damage near the output sometimes caused pure visual errors. Indeed, the characteristic error pattern of deep dyslexia occurred with damage to virtually any part of the network.},

From a recording of a mother speaking to her child, matched samples were constructed by inserting pauses either at clause boundaries or at within-clause locations. The infants oriented longer to the samples segmented at the clause boundary. A second experiment confirmed that these preferences depended on where the pauses were inserted in the samples. These findings have important implications for understanding how language is learnable. The prelinguistic infant apparently possesses the means to detect important units such as clauses, within which grammatical rules apply.},

However, the problem with their line of argument is that IL and PBL approaches are highly scaffolded. In this article, we first demonstrate that Kirschner et al. have mistakenly conflated PBL and IL with discovery learning. We then present evidence demonstrating that PBL and IL are powerful and effective models of learning. Far from being contrary to many of the principles of guided learning that Kirschner et al. discussed, both PBL and IL employ scaffolding extensively thereby reducing the cognitive load and allowing students to learn in complex domains. Moreover, these approaches to learning address important goals of education that include content knowledge, epistemic practices, and soft skills such as collaboration and self-directed learning.},

Processing along the feedforward hierarchy of areas, leading to increasingly complex representations, is automatic and implicit, while conscious perception begins at the hierarchy's top, gradually returning downward as needed. Thus, our initial conscious percept—vision at a glance—matches a high-level, generalized, categorical scene interpretation, identifying “forest before trees.” For later vision with scrutiny, reverse hierarchy routines focus attention to specific, active, low-level units, incorporating into conscious perception detailed information available there. Reverse Hierarchy Theory dissociates between early explicit perception and implicit low-level vision, explaining a variety of phenomena. Feature search “pop-out” is attributed to high areas, where large receptive fields underlie spread attention detecting categorical differences. Search for conjunctions or fine discriminations depends on reentry to low-level specific receptive fields using serial focused attention, consistent with recently reported primary visual cortex effects.},

We start by a discussion of standards for developing and evaluating cognitive models, followed by example demonstrations. In doing so, we relate IAM representations to word length, sequence, frequency, repetition, and orthographic neighborhood effects in behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies along the ventral visual stream. We then examine to what extent lexical competition can account for anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation and the N2/N400 complex. The subsequent section presents the Associative Read-Out Model (AROM), which extends the scope of IAMs by introducing explicit memory and semantic representations. Thereby, it can account for false memories, and familiarity and recollection – explaining why memory signal variances are greater for studied than non-studied items. Since the AROM captures associative spreading across semantic long-term memory, it can also account for different temporal lobe functions, and allows for item-level predictions of the left inferior frontal gyrus’ BOLD response. Finally, we use the AROM to examine whether semantic cohesiveness can account for effects previously ascribed to affective word features, i.e. emotional valence, and show that this is the case for positive, but not for negative valence.},

Modern theories of retrieval in sentence comprehension do not indicate how this variation and the role of encoding processes should influence memory performance.

Three self-paced reading experiments provide evidence that reading times at retrieval sites (but not earlier) decrease when more complex phrases occur as filler phrases in filler-gap dependencies. The data also show that complexity-based effects are not dependent on string length, syntactic differences, or the amount of processing the stimuli elicit. Activation boosting and reduced similarity-based interference are implicated as likely sources of these complexity-based effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Ss pressed a button to a low probability nonsense syllable (target, p = .168) and ignored all other events, which included a high probability nonsense syllable (nontarget, p = .664) and either low probability (category, p = .168) symbols (Block 1) or 3-letter words (Block 2). The amplitudes of several late ERP components and the latency of the late positive (P3) component were examined. Results indicate that the overall amplitude of P3 was significantly smaller in all clinical groups than in controls, but the difference in P3 amplitude between targets and nontargets was smaller only in the 2 attentional deficit groups. Reading disabled Ss had smaller P3 and Pc components to words than to symbols, while controls had equivalent values. The N2 component had a different scalp distribution for words and symbols but did not differentiate reading disabled Ss from controls. P3 latency was significantly longer in the 3 clinical groups than in controls, but only the attentional deficit groups showed an increase in P3 latency across blocks of the task.

In Experiment 1, target words were either repetitions of the prior masked prime (car-CAR) or were another unrelated word (job-CAR). In Experiment 2, primes and targets were either semantically related (cap-HAT) or were unrelated (car-HAT). Unrelated target words produced larger N400s than did repeated (Exp 1) or semantically related (Exp 2) words across the different prime durations and these N400 priming effects tended to be smaller overall for semantic than repetition priming. Moreover, there was only a modest decline in the size of N400 repetition priming at the shortest prime durations, and there was no relationship between this N400 effect and a measure of prime categorization performance. However, the size of semantic priming at the shortest durations was relatively smaller than at longer durations and was correlated with prime categorization performance. The findings are discussed in the context of the functional significance of the N400 as well as a model that argues for different mechanisms during masked repetition and semantic priming.

Two experiments examined between-modality interactions across three prime-target intervals (0, 200, and 800 ms) in a cross-modal repetition priming paradigm. Event-related potentials were recorded to auditory targets following visual primes (Experiment 1) or visual targets following auditory primes (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1 robust repetition effects were found for auditory targets as early as 100 ms, and continued through the N400 epoch. Moreover, these visual-auditory repetition effects were large across all three prime-target intervals although they onset 200 ms later at the shortest interval. In Experiment 2 repetition effects to visual targets started later (at 200 ms), but also offset relatively later (approximately 1000 ms). These auditory-visual repetition effects were both smaller overall and absent for the two shortest prime-target intervals during the typical N400 window.},

This hypothesis has been well supported, but some recent data are inconsistent with its predictions. It is becoming increasingly clear that multiple selective agents, and non-selective constraints, must have acted to shape cognitive abilities in humans and other animals. The task now is to develop a larger theoretical framework that takes into account both inter-specific differences and similarities in cognition. This new framework should facilitate consideration of how selection pressures that are associated with sociality interact with those that are imposed by non-social forms of environmental complexity, and how both types of functional demands interact with phylogenetic and developmental constraints.

Targets were preceded by a visually presented related (translation equivalent/repeated) or unrelated prime. The results showed that the amplitudes of the N250 and N400 ERP components were significantly modulated for L2–L2 repetition priming, L1–L2 translation priming, and L1–L1 repetition priming, but not for L2–L1 translation priming. There was also evidence for priming effects in an earlier 100–200 ms time window for L1–L1 repetition priming and L1–L2 translation priming. We argue that a change in script across primes and targets provides optimal conditions for prime word processing, hence generating very fast-acting translation priming effects when primes are in L1.},

The results showed that reading Chinese passive relative primes reduced processing difficulty in English targets at the dispreferred disambiguation. Chinese-to-English priming in comprehension occurred without lexical and word-order equivalence between primes and targets. In addition, translation-equivalent verbs did not boost cross-linguistic structural priming.

  abstract = {Whether a word has an irregular inflection does not depend on its sound alone: compare lie-lay (recline) and lie-lied (prevaricate). Theories of morphology, particularly connectionist and symbolic models, disagree on which nonphonological factors are responsible. We test four possibilities: (1) Lexical effects, in which two lemmas differ in whether they specify an irregular form; (2) Semantic effects, in which the semantic features of a word become associated with regular or irregular forms; (3) Morphological structure effects, in which a word with a headless structure (e.g., a verb derived from a noun) blocks access to a stored irregular form; (4) Compositionality effects, in which the stored combination of an irregular word’s meaning (e.g., the verb’s inherent aspect) with the meaning of the inflection (e.g., pastness) doesn’t readily transfer to new senses with different combinations of such meanings. In four experiments, speakers were presented with existing and novel verbs and asked to rate their past-tense forms, semantic similarities, grammatical structure, and aspectual similarities. We found (1) an interaction between semantic and phonological similarity, coinciding with reported strategies of analogizing to known verbs and implicating lexical effects; (2) weak and inconsistent effects of semantic similarity; (3) robust effects of morphological structure, and (4) robust effects of aspectual compositionality. Results are consistent with theories of language that invoke lexical entries and morphological structure, and which differentiate the mode of storage of regular and irregular verbs. They also suggest how psycholinguistic processes have shaped vocabulary structure over history.},

In the pesent paper these paterns have been examined by the 2-deoxyuglucose autoradiographic method developed by Sokoloff and his group (Kennedy et al, '76). An anesthetized monkey was given an injection of 14C 2-deoxyglucose and then visually stimulated for 45 minues with a large array of moving vertical stripes, with both eyes open. The 14C autoradiographs of striate cortex showed vertical bands of label extending through the full cortical thickness. Layer I was at most only lightly labelled, and layers IV b and VI wee the most dense. Layer IV c (the site of terminations of most geniculate afferents) was labelled uniformly along its length, as expected from the lack of orientation specificity of units recorded in that leyer. In the other layers the pattern seen in tangential sections was complex, consisting of swirling stripes with many bifurcations and blind endings, but with occasional more regular regions whee the stripes wee roughly parallel. Interstripe distance was rather constant, at 570 μm. Ocular dominance columns were examined in this same monkey, in the same region, by injecting one eye with 3H-proline two weeks before the deoxyglucose experiment, and preparing a second set of autoradiographs of the sections after prolonged washing to remove the 14C-deoxyglucose. As seen in tangential sections through layer IV c, these columns had the usual stripe-like form, with a period of 770 μm, but were simpler in their pattern than the orientation stripes, with fewer bifurcations and less swirling. A comparison of the two sets of columns in the same area showed many intersections, but no strict or consistent relationships: angles of intersection showed a distribution that was not obviously different from that expected for any two randomly superimposed sets of lines. Another monkey was stimulated with vertical stripes, but with only one eye open. Deoxyglucose autoradiographs of tangential sections showed regular uniform rows of label in layer IV c, with all the characteristic features of eye dominance columns. In the layers above and below IV c the rows in tangential view were broken up into regularly spaced patches of label, presumably representing aggregations of cells responsive to vertically oriented stimuli. The patches showed no consistent alignment across the ocular dominance rows, and indeed no such tendency would be expected, considering the complexity of the orientation columns. This pattern of labelling is again predicted from and confirms the previous physiological studies.},

The chapter begins with some general comments about why the relation between language and theory of mind is likely to be very complex. Two related points concern definitions for theory of mind and developmental shifts in the nature of relations between theory of mind and language. A third point concerns the distinction between the factors that underlie associations between individual differences in theory of mind and language, and those that underpin developmental links between these two domains. Taken together, these points highlight the need for a greater range and sophistication of methodological designs within theory-of-mind research. In response to this gap, in the second part of this chapter the author considers the merits of the twin-study design as a novel methodological perspective from which to investigate individual differences in theory of mind. This section begins with an outline of some of the terms used in behavioral genetic research, and of the rationale for twin studies. Next, findings from the only published theory-of-mind twin study to date and from a more recent and much larger twin study are briefly presented. The chapter ends with a discussion of how the contrasting findings from these two studies may suggest developmental change in the relations between individual differences in theory of mind and language.

Participants were presented with words (in Experiments 1 and 3) and nonwords (in Experiment 2) that contained a buried word whose letters differed in color relative to the other letters present (e.g.,pig, in spring). The strings were presented in single case or mixed case, keeping the letters of the buried words in one case (SpRiNg). The time in which the whole stimulus was named was shorter for same-case than for mixed-case strings (forspring: spring {$<$} SpRiNg). In contrast, the time in which buried words were named was shorter in mixed- than in same-case strings (forpig: spring {$>$} SpRiNg). Across items, the effects of case mixing were negatively correlated across the two tasks. The positive effect of case mixing for buried words also occurred irrespective of whether the whole string was a word or a nonword, and there were contributions from similarity of both letter size and case. The results suggest that case mixing can facilitate selective attention to letters, which is otherwise disrupted by size- and case-based grouping across letter strings. The study provides evidence for letter grouping using size and case information.},

In these landmark volumes, leading researchers across a range of disciplines provide a state-of-the-art view of imitation, integrating the latest findings and theories with reviews of seminal work, and revealing why imitation is a topic of such intense current scientific interest. Perspectives are drawn from neuroscience and brain imaging, animal and developmental psychology, primatology, ethology, philosophy, anthropology, media studies, economics, sociology, education, and law. These volumes provide a resource that makes this research accessible across disciplines and clarifies its importance for the social sciences and philosophy as well as for the cognitive sciences. As a further aid to cross-fertilization, each volume includes extensive interdisciplinary commentary and discussion.The first volume considers possible mechanisms of imitation, including discussion of mirror systems, ideomotor and common coding theories, and the possibility of "shared circuits" for control, imitation, and simulation, and then takes up imitation in animals, with illuminating comparisons to human imitation. The second volume focuses first on the roles of imitation in human development and in learning to understand the minds of others, and then on the broader social and cultural roles and functions of imitation, including discussions of meme theory and cultural evolution, and of the pervasive imitative tendencies of normal adults and their relevance for understanding the effects of the media on human behavior.},

This longitudinal study (n = 27) explores whether Spanish-learning children's early experiences with language predict efficiency in real-time comprehension and vocabulary learning. Measures of mothers’ speech at 18 months were examined in relation to children's speech processing efficiency and reported vocabulary at 18 and 24 months. Children of mothers who provided more input at 18 months knew more words and were faster in word recognition at 24 months. Moreover, multiple regression analyses indicated that the influences of caregiver speech on speed of word recognition and vocabulary were largely overlapping. This study provides the first evidence that input shapes children's lexical processing efficiency and that vocabulary growth and increasing facility in spoken word comprehension work together to support the uptake of the information that rich input affords the young language learner.},

The experiment with isolated words replicated previous lexical decision studies by showing more effortful processing for inflected than monomorphemic nouns. However, this morphological complexity effect did not generalise to the context experiments; fixation durations and response latencies were highly similar for inflected and monomorphemic words. It is suggested that, at least for the type of inflected nouns studied, the morphological effect observed for isolated words may derive from the syntactic and/or semantic level and not necessarily from the lexical level, as previously assumed.

A standard model maintains that Arabic words are typically analyzable into a three-consonantal root morpheme carrying the core meaning of words and a prosodic template responsible mostly for grammatical information. This view has been largely supported by research in both theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics. An alternative theory holds that the meaning of words in Arabic is, rather, encoded in the 'etymon' comprising two unordered consonants of the root only. Results from a recent priming experiment have shown that the etymon induces strong morphological priming effects, supporting its morphological/ lexical status. In this paper we present data from a patient with deep dyslexia questioning the role of the etymon as a psychologically real representational unit in Arabic and arguing, instead, for the central role of the root in both morphological and lexical representation in this language.

Methods: Subjects (n=32) were instructed to respond to the display color of a word but to ignore its meaning. Display color was congruent, neutral, or incongruent with word meaning. Results: Stroop facilitation and interference effects were observed, as RT was shortest in the congruent condition, intermediate in the neutral condition, and longest in the incongruent condition. In contrast, P300 latency did not vary across color/word congruence conditions, suggesting that the RT difference between congruence conditions originated after stimulus evaluation. Conclusions: These manual RT/P300 findings support the view that Stroop interference and facilitation originate from response competition between the relevant and irrelevant stimulus attributes. By employing an arbitrary mapping of color words onto buttons, the present results indicate that the disparate effects of Stroop stimuli on RT and P300 latency do not depend on the nature of the S-R translation.},

Two main factors were manipulated: (1) The degree of complexity of the morphosyntactic violation, (2) The moment when the agreement violation occurs within the sentence. Both types of morphological agreement violations (intra/inter) elicited a biphasic anterior negativity/P600 ERP pattern. However, the amplitude of this pattern was larger for the interphrasal violation than for the intraphrasal one. This result suggests an easier detection but a more costly integration when the agreement violation occurs between elements belonging to different syntactic units. Moreover, an effect of position was observed but only when the violation concerned elements of a single syntactic unit. Taken together, the present findings suggest that morphological integration may be modulated by both the complexity of morphosyntactic agreement and the moment at which it takes place during the course of sentence processing.

  abstract = {The human visual system can rapidly recognize objects despite transformations that alter their appearance. The precise timing of when the brain computes neural representations that are invariant to particular transformations, however, has not been mapped in humans. Here we employ magnetoencephalography decoding analysis to measure the dynamics of size- and position-invariant visual information development in the ventral visual stream. With this method we can read out the identity of objects beginning as early as 60 ms. Size- and position-invariant visual information appear around 125 ms and 150 ms, respectively, and both develop in stages, with invariance to smaller transformations arising before invariance to larger transformations. Additionally, the magnetoencephalography sensor activity localizes to neural sources that are in the most posterior occipital regions at the early decoding times and then move temporally as invariant information develops. These results provide previously unknown latencies for key stages of human-invariant object recognition, as well as new and compelling evidence for a feed-forward hierarchical model of invariant object recognition where invariance increases at each successive visual area along the ventral stream.},

Reaction time facilitation is obtained for letters in the nominally identical condition if the different condition serves as baseline, but not if a within-condition baseline is used. Words are classified more rapidly as words when preceded by a physically or nominally identical stimulus. Results demonstrate that target processing in speeded letter and word classification depends on prime type and prime intensity, and it is argued that standard interpretation of priming effects is better constrained by the double baseline approach of this technique.

The experimental task elicited clitic pronouns serving as direct objects with finite verbs (lo, la, los, and las). The children who had SLI used clitic pronouns less frequently than their age-matched peers and were less accurate in their use of gender agreement for clitics. No group differences were found for third person singular and plural verb inflections in the preterite tense. These results were compared to previous studies of Spanish- and Italian-speaking children with SLI. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The environment, the interval between the study and testing phases, and the overlap in new and old words was varied. Results show that perceptual enhancement persisted over days but, like recognition memory, was influenced by manipulations of retrieval conditions.

However, the reasons for this correlation are unclear, and questions remain regarding which aspects of language are related to which aspects of ToM, when, and perhaps most important, why. In this chapter, the authors argue that one aspect of language (labeling) is related to standard preschool measures of ToM (e.g., false-belief, representational-change, and appearance-reality tasks) because these measures of ToM all require cognitive flexibility, which undergoes dramatic changes during the preschool years. In support of this argument, the authors briefly review the results of recent experimental research on the effects of labeling on tasks that assess cognitive flexibility. The results of these studies indicate that there are widespread changes in the effects of labeling on 4-year-olds' performance on these tasks. The chapter concludes with predictions for future experimental labeling manipulations with ToM tasks that might shed light on the causal nature of the relation between language and ToM.

A previously documented “reading circuit” was recruited during letter perception only after handwriting—not after typing or tracing experience.

An important challenge for these accounts is explaining how abstract concepts, which do not directly call upon sensory or motor information, can be informed by experience. We propose that metaphor is one important vehicle guiding the development and use of abstract concepts. Metaphors allow us to draw on concrete, familiar domains to acquire and reason about abstract concepts. Additionally, repeated metaphoric use drawing on particular aspects of concrete experience can result in the development of new abstract representations. These abstractions, which are derived from embodied experience but lack much of the sensorimotor information associated with it, can then be flexibly applied to understand new situations.},

Our main objective was to ascertain whether morphosyntactic category violations would differ from violations of prosodic constraints. For each type of incorrect suffixation, the data yielded an N400-like effect, but the processing of incorrectly derived words varies according to the type of violation: Effects for -ung- and -heit violations appeared approximately 200 ms earlier than for -keit-violations. Furthermore, the negativity effect for -ung was stronger and distributed over the whole scalp, whereas the effect for -heit and -keit is restricted to parietal electrodes. We interpret the differences as suggesting that different word formation restrictions play different roles in the processing of derived words, such that morphosyntactic restrictions are more salient than prosodic ones.},

To test these alternatives, the performance of participants on transparent (foolish), quasi-transparent (bookish), opaque (vanish), and orthographic control words (bucket) was examined in a series of 5 experiments. In Experiments 1-3 variants of a masked priming lexical-decision task were used; Experiment 4 used a masked priming semantic decision task, and Experiment 5 used a single-word (nonpriming) semantic decision task with a color-boundary manipulation. In addition to the behavioral data, event-related potential (ERP) data were collected in Experiments 1, 2, 4, and 5. Across all experiments, we observed a graded effect of semantic transparency in behavioral and ERP data, with the largest effect for semantically transparent words, the next largest for quasi-transparent words, and the smallest for opaque words.

Experiment 1 used multisyllabic words that vary in terms of the consistency of component spelling-sound correspondences. The stimuli were regular, regular inconsistent, and exception words analogous to the monosyllabic items used in previous studies. Both regular inconsistent and exception words produced longer naming latencies than regular words. In Experiment 2 these differences between word types were found to be limited to lower frequency items. Experiment 3 showed that effects of number of syllables on naming latency are also limited to lower frequency words. In the final experiment, consistency effects were obtained for both higher and lower frequency words when the stimulus display forced subjects to use syllabic units. Thus, frequency modulates the effects of two aspects of lexical structure--consistency of spelling-sound correspondences and number of syllables. The results suggest that the naming of multisyllabic words draws on some of the same knowledge representations and processes as monosyllabic words; however, naming does not require syllabic decomposition. The results are discussed in the context of current models of naming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved).},

The question is whether structural invariance of the morphological category (i.e., lack of allomorphy) would affect the processing of Finnish derived words. A series of four visual lexical decision experiments in which alternatively surface and base frequency was manipulated showed that the two invariant suffixes, namely denominal –stO and deadjectival –hkO, showed reliable effects of base frequency, whereas for the two categories with suffix allomorphy, deverbal –Us and deadjectival –(U)Us, only surface frequency played a role. A further experiment showed that even with the most frequent variant of –(U)Us, namely –Ude-, response latencies were a function of surface frequency only. It is shown that neither the results from the experiments here nor previous findings from processing Finnish words can be accounted for by suffix frequency, the frequency ratio between the derived word and its base, or morphological productivity in any straightforward manner. We conclude that the lack of allomorphy, that is, structural invariance, significantly adds to affixal salience and therefore enhances morphological decomposition. The implications of this finding for models of lexical processing are discussed.},

Recently Järvikivi and Niemi (in press) have provided converging evidence for their claim based on a series of lexical decision experiments with Finnish stem allomorphs. The results from the present series of four follow-up experiments reported here showed that (isolated) bound stem allomorphs primed the recognition of the corresponding monomorphemic nouns significantly compared both to phonologically unrelated pseudowords and to phonologically minimally different pseudowords. Furthermore, not only did both phonologically transparent and opaque case inflected nouns prime the corresponding nominative singulars, but also there was no difference in priming between the two. The results are well in accordance and corroborate the hypotheses drawn from the earlier investigations. Moreover, they further indicate that bound stem allomorphs have representations on a purely formal level only, i.e., they serve as indices of and entering points to morphological/morphosyntactic information.},

  abstract = {Within the last 10 years, there has been an upsurge of interest in face processing abilities in autism which has generated a proliferation of new empirical demonstrations employing a variety of measuring techniques. Observably atypical social behaviors early in the development of children with autism have led to the contention that autism is a condition where the processing of social information, particularly faces, is impaired. While several empirical sources of evidence lend support to this hypothesis, others suggest that there are conditions under which autistic individuals do not differ from typically developing persons. The present paper reviews this bulk of empirical evidence, and concludes that the versatility and abilities of face processing in persons with autism have been underestimated.

The bilateral visual cortices of the early blind were significantly thicker than those of the late blind and the sighted controls, but the latter two groups did not differ significantly. This suggests reduced “pruning” of synapses in the visual cortex, which may be due to a lack of visual experience during a critical developmental period. These findings support the hypothesis that sensory experience is necessary for an appropriate regression and remodeling of neuronal processes and that synaptic regression might be a major determinant of macroscopic anatomical features like cortical thickness.},

  abstract = {The last 40 years have witnessed a growing interest in the mechanisms underlying the visual identification of complex words. A large amount of experimental data has been amassed, but although a growing number of studies are proposing explicit theoretical models for their data, no comprehensive theory has gained substantial agreement among scholars in the field. We believe that this is due, at least in part, to the presence of several controversial pieces of evidence in the literature and, consequently, to the lack of a well-defined set of experimental facts that any theory should be able to explain. With this review, we aim to delineate the state of the art in the research on the visual identification of complex words. By reviewing major empirical evidences in a number of different paradigms such as lexical decision, word naming, and masked and unmasked priming, we were able to identify a series of effects that we judge as reliable or that were consistently replicated in different experiments, along with some more controversial data, which we have tried to resolve and explain. We concentrated on behavioral and electrophysiological studies on inflected, derived, and compound words, so as to span over all types of complex words. The outcome of this work is an analytical summary of well-established facts on the most relevant morphological issues, such as regularity, morpheme position coding, family size, semantic transparency, morpheme frequency, suffix allomorphy, and productivity, morphological entropy, and morpho-orthographic parsing. In discussing this set of benchmark effects, we have drawn some methodological considerations on why contrasting evidence might have emerged, and have tried to delineate a target list for the construction of a new all-inclusive model of the visual identification of morphologically complex words.

Brain-injured patients differ with respect to whether they are more impaired in generating irregular past tenses (take–took) or past tenses for nonce verbs (wug–wugged). Such dissociations have been taken as evidence for distinct “rule” and “associative” memory systems in morphology and against the connectionist approach in which a single system is used for all forms. We describe a simulation model in which these impairments arise from damage to phonological or semantic information, which have different effects on generalization and irregular forms, respectively. The results provide an account of the bases of impairments in verb morphology and show that these impairments can be explained within connectionist models that do not use rules or a separate mechanism for exceptions.},

Three dyslexic groups were identified: phonological dyslexics (PD), developmentally language impaired (LI), and globally delayed (delay-type dyslexics). The LI and PD groups exhibited similar patterns of reading impairment, attributed to low phonological skills. However, only the LI group showed clear speech perception deficits, suggesting that such deficits affect only a subset of dyslexics. Results also indicated phonological impairments in children whose speech perception was normal. Both the LI and the PD groups showed inflectional morphology difficulties, with the impairment being more severe in the LI group. The delay group's reading and language skills closely matched those of younger normal readers, suggesting these children had a general delay in reading and language skills, rather than a specific phonological impairment. The results are discussed in terms of models of word recognition and dyslexia.},

This article reports three experiments investigating the development of abstract representations in artificial grammar learning (AGL), using a methodological approach developed by Conway and Christiansen (2006). In all the experiments, the number of blocks during the exposure phase was manipulated (6 blocks vs. 18 blocks of exposure to sequences). Experiments 1 and 2 investigated both visual and auditory learning where sequences were presented element-by-element. Experiment 3 investigated visual learning using a sequence-by-sequence presentation technique more commonly used in visual AGL studies. Extending previous research (Conway \& Christiansen, 2006) and in support of stimulus-specific accounts, the results of the experiments showed that extended observational learning results in increased stimulus-specific knowledge rather than abstraction towards surface-independent representations.},

The authors also explored whether infants find speech cues produced by coarticulation useful in word segmentation. Using natural speech syllables, the authors replicated J. R. Saffrin and R. N.

Exp 2 pitted stress against statistics, whereas Exp 3 pitted coarticulation against statistics. In both cases, 8-mo-olds weighed speech cues more heavily than statistical cues. This observation was verified in Exp 4, which indicated that greater complexity of the familiarization sequence does not necessarily lead to familiarity effects.

Although language-advanced first graders produced stronger evidence suggesting morphophonemic segments than language-delayed age-mates, and young adults supplied stronger evidence than either first-grade group; strength of evidence leads to the interpretation that even language-delayed 6-year-olds form morphophonemic segments.

In each trial, a printed letter was presented synchronously with an auditory letter name. Incongruent (mismatched), frequent trials were interleaved with congruent (matched) infrequent target pairs, which participants were asked to report by pressing a button. In critical trials, incongruent letter pairs were mismatched but confusable in terms of their visual or phonological features. Typical readers showed early detection of deviant trials, indicated by larger modulation in the range of the phonological mismatch negativity (PMN) compared with standard trials. This was followed by stronger modulation of the P3b wave for visually confusable deviants and an increased lateralized readiness potential (LRP) for phonological deviants, compared with standards. In contrast, dyslexic readers showed reduced sensitivity to deviancy in the PMN range. Responses to deviants in the P3b range indicated normal letter recognition processes, but the LRP calculation revealed a specific impairment for visual-orthographic information during response selection in dyslexia. In a follow-up experiment using an analogous nonlexical task in the same participants, we found no reading-group differences, indicating a degree of specificity to over-learnt visual-phonological binding. Our findings indicate early insensitivity to visual-phonological binding in developmental dyslexia, coupled with difficulty selecting the correct orthographic code.

This paper reports an interview-based study looking at the issue of ‘pleasure’ in product use. The study was a ‘first pass’ at addressing the hedonic and experiential benefits and penalties associated with product use, and at identifying the properties of a product that influence how pleasurable or displeasurable it is to use. Feelings associated with using pleasurable products included security, confidence, pride, excitement and satisfaction. Displeasurable products, meanwhile, were associated with feelings that included annoyance, anxiety, contempt and frustration. The properties of products that were salient in terms of influencing the level of pleasure/displeasure with a product included features, usability, aesthetics, performance and reliability. Responses to questions investigating behavioural correlates to pleasure in product use suggested that pleasurable products were used more regularly and that future purchase choices would be affected by the level of pleasure in product use. It is concluded that the issue of pleasure in product use involves more than usability alone. As the user's representative in the product creation process, the human factors specialist should consider many other factors in order to ensure that the user's experience of product use is maximised.},

This study discusses two proposals for models of the Japanese mental lexicon–H. Hirose's (1992) hypotheses and a Japanese lemma-unit version of the multilevel interactive-activation framework–in terms of their ability to cope with this diversity. As the proposals make different predictions concerning constituent-morpheme priming, patterns of facilitation were examined in two experiments with five word-formation principles as experimental conditions. A total of 87 university students participated. Experiment 1, using the long stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 3000 ms employed by Hirose, only found significant differences between the first- and second-element conditions in one of the word-formation conditions. Experiment 2, using a short SOA of 250 ms, confirmed the pattern of priming obtained in Experiment 1. These results are more consistent with the prediction from the Japanese lemma-unit model.

Long and short compound words were presented in neutral sentences and eye movements were recorded while participants read the sentences to investigate the time course of compound word recognition. In Experiment 1, the frequency of the beginning lexeme was manipulated in addition to word length while in Experiment 2 rated frequency was manipulated. These experiments represented attempts to extend Bertram and Hyönä's (2003) work with Finnish compounds to English and to test the parallel dual-route model of compound processing. Predictions from this model would be that only long compound words should demonstrate a beginning lexeme frequency effect and short compound words should show an earlier effect of whole-word frequency. Contrary to this, short compound words did show a large beginning lexeme frequency effect as well as whole word frequency effects. These results will be problematic for parallel dual – route models to explain.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Electrical potentials produced by blinks and eye movements present serious problems for electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) data interpretation and analysis, particularly for analysis of data from some clinical populations. Often, all epochs contaminated by large eye artifacts are rejected as unusable, though this may prove unacceptable when blinks and eye movements occur frequently. Methods: Frontal channels are often used as reference signals to regress out eye artifacts, but inevitably portions of relevant EEG signals also appearing in EOG channels are thereby eliminated or mixed into other scalp channels. A generally applicable adaptive method for removing artifacts from EEG records based on blind source separation by independent component analysis (ICA) (Neural Computation 7 (1995) 1129; Neural Computation 10(8) (1998) 2103; Neural Computation 11(2) (1999) 606) overcomes these limitations. Results: Results on EEG data collected from 28 normal controls and 22 clinical subjects performing a visual selective attention task show that ICA can be used to effectively detect, separate and remove ocular artifacts from even strongly contaminated EEG recordings. The results compare favorably to those obtained using rejection or regression methods. Conclusions: The ICA method can preserve ERP contributions from all of the recorded trials and all the recorded data channels, even when none of the single trials are artifact-free.},

  abstract = {Eye movements, eye blinks, cardiac signals, muscle noise,  and line noise present serious problems for electroencephalographic  (EEG) interpretation and analysis when rejecting contaminated  EEG segments results in an unacceptable data loss. Many  methods have been proposed to remove artifacts from EEG  recordings, especially those arising from eye movements  and blinks. Often regression in the time or frequency domain  is performed on parallel EEG and electrooculographic (EOG)  recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance  and spread of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. Because  EEG and ocular activity mix bidirectionally, regressing  out eye artifacts inevitably involves subtracting relevant  EEG signals from each record as well. Regression methods  become even more problematic when a good regressing channel  is not available for each artifact source, as in the case  of muscle artifacts. Use of principal component analysis  (PCA) has been proposed to remove eye artifacts from multichannel  EEG. However, PCA cannot completely separate eye artifacts  from brain signals, especially when they have comparable  amplitudes. Here, we propose a new and generally applicable  method for removing a wide variety of artifacts from EEG  records based on blind source separation by independent  component analysis (ICA). Our results on EEG data collected  from normal and autistic subjects show that ICA can effectively  detect, separate, and remove contamination from a wide  variety of artifactual sources in EEG records with results  comparing favorably with those obtained using regression  and PCA methods. ICA can also be used to analyze blink-related  brain activity.},

How might the infant begin this process? The present study was designed to examine the potential role that sensitivity to predominant stress patterns of words might play in lexical development. In English, by far the majority of words have stressed (strong) initial syllables. Experiment 1 of our study demonstrated that by 9 months of age American infants listen significantly longer to words with strong/weak stress patterns than to words with weak/strong stress patterns. However, Experiment 2 showed that no significant preferences for the predominant stress pattern appear with 6-month-old infants, which suggests that the preference develops as a result of increasing familiarity with the prosodic features of the native language. In a third experiment, 9-month-olds showed a preference for strong/weak patterns even when the speech input was low-pass filtered, which suggests that their preference is specifically for the prosodic structure of the words. Together the results suggest that attention to predominant stress patterns in the native language may form an important part of the infant's process of developing a lexicon.},

In Experiment 1, participants described a series of pictures previously used in studies of cortical aphasic patients. The cerebellar patients did not differ significantly from the controls in the total number of words produced or in the proportion of closed-class words. They did differ to a marginally significant extent in the production of required articles. In Experiment 2, participants identified the agent in a series of aurally presented sentences in which three agency cues (subject-verb agreement, word order, and noun animacy) were manipulated. The cerebellar patients were less affected than the controls were by the manipulation of subject-verb agreement to a marginally significant extent. In Experiment 3, participants performed a grammaticality judgment task on a series of aurally presented sentences. The cerebellar patients were significantly less able to discriminate grammatical and ungrammatical sentences than the controls were, particularly when the error was of subject verb agreement as opposed to word order. The results suggest that damage to the cerebellum can result in subtle impairments in the use of grammatical morphology, and are discussed in light of hypothesized roles for the cerebellum in language.

We present N400 event-related potential data from healthy participants using the same design. Both regular and irregular past-tense forms primed corresponding present-tense forms, but with a longer duration for irregular verbs. Phonological control conditions suggested that differences in formal overlap between prime and target contribute to, but do not account for, this difference, suggesting a link between irregular morphology and semantics. Further analysis dividing the irregular verbs into two categories (weak irregular and strong) revealed that priming for strong verbs was reliably stronger than that for weak irregular and regular verbs, which were statistically indistinguishable from one another. We argue that, although we observe a regular-irregular dissociation, the nature of this dissociation is more consistent with single- than with dual-system models of inflectional morphology.

Next, in Experiment 1, we show that the P600 is elicited in grammatical, non-garden path sentences in which integration is more difficult (i.e., ”who” questions) relative to a control sentence (”whether” questions). This effect is replicated in Experiment 2. Furthermore, we directly compare the effect of difficult integration in grammatical sentences to the effect of agreement violations. The results suggest that the positivity elicited in ”who” questions and the P600-effect elicited by agreement violations have partly overlapping neural generators. This supports the hypothesis that similar cognitive processes, i.e., integration, are involved in both first pass analysis of ”who” questions and dealing with ungrammaticalities (reanalysis).},

In the present study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to help identify the nature of these processes by directly comparing ERPs to complex ambiguous sentence structures with and without grammatical violations, and to simpler unambiguous sentence structures with and without grammatical violations. In ambiguous sentences, preference of syntactic analysis was manipulated such that in one condition, the structures agreed with the preferred analysis, and in another condition, a nonpreferred but syntactically correct analysis (garden path) was imposed. Nonpreferred ambiguous structures require revision, whereas ungrammatical structures require repair. We found that distinct ERPs reflected different characteristics of syntactic processing. Specifically, our results are consistent with the idea that a positivity with a posterior distribution across the scalp (posterior P600) is an index of syntactic processing difficulty, including repair and revision, and that a frontally distributed positivity (frontal P600) is related to ambiguity resolution and/ or to an increase in discourse level complexity.},

Similar literal and metaphor priming effects were found in both visual fields across most experimental conditions. However, RH processes also maintained activation of sententially inconsistent literal meanings following metaphoric expressions. These results do not strongly support the RH as the preferred substrate for metaphor comprehension (e.g., Anaki et al., 1998, Bottini et al., 1994), and suggest that processes in both hemispheres can support metaphor comprehension, although not via identical mechanisms. The LH may utilize sentence constraint to select and integrate only contextually relevant literal and metaphoric meanings, whereas the RH may be less sensitive to sentence context and can maintain the activation of some alternative interpretations. This may be potentially useful in situations where an initial understanding must be revised.},

An experimental on-line error detection (ED) paradigm was used to examine how variations in linguistic material (LM) interposed between the subject and the verb affected the detection of number-VAG violations. The time needed for the detection of verbal agreement errors was found to depend largely on the structure and nature of the LM interposed between the subject noun and the verb. Also, ED took more time when the local noun in the interposed sequence mismatched the subject noun in number, than when the 2 nouns matched. Finally, ED seemed to be affected mainly by subject head-noun lexical properties rather than by local noun features. Data suggest that structural properties of the LM interposed between the subject head noun and the verb, and morphological information relative to head noun number, can influence VAG processing.

  abstract = {The most widely used text in its course area, James W. Kalat's BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY has appealed to thousands of students before you. Why? Kalat's main goal is to make Biological Psychology understandable to Psychology students, not just to Biology majors and pre meds--and he delivers. Another goal is to convey the excitement of the search for biological explanations of behavior. Kalat believes that Biological Psychology is "the most interesting topic in the world," and this text convinces many students--and maybe you, too--with clear writing, amusing anecdotes and intriguing examples. MindTap, an interactive online learning resource that integrates the text with videos, animations and a virtual bio-lab component, makes learning even easier and more enjoyable.},

  abstract = {Three experiments investigated whether morphological constituents influence word processing during reading. Individuals read sentences containing free stem, bound stem, and pseudo-prefixed words. In Experiments 1 and 2, a parafoveal display change manipulation indicated that the morphological constituents of a prefixed word are not available for preprocessing in the parafovea as reading times on the target word did not differ for prefixed versus pseudo-prefixed words. Interestingly, parafoveal preview of word initial and word final letters resulted in an equivalent amount orthographic facilitation for all word types. In Experiment 3, a fast priming manipulation indicated that morphological priming effects for prefixed words are obscured during sentence processing. However, the form of the prime did facilitate subsequent word processing for all three word types. The results suggest that English prefixed words are accessed via their whole word form, as there was no evidence of morphological decomposition for prefixed words during sentence processing.

At the cortical level, mentalizing (attribution of metal states) is underpinned by the coordination and integration of the components of the ToM network, which include the medial frontal gyrus, the anterior paracingulate, and the right temporoparietal junction. The pivotal new finding was a functional underconnectivity (a lower degree of synchronization) in autism, especially in the connections between frontal and posterior areas during the attribution of mental states. In addition, the frontal ToM regions activated less in participants with autism relative to control participants. In the autism group, an independent psychometric assessment of ToM ability and the activation in the right temporoparietal junction were reliably correlated. The results together provide new evidence for the biological basis of atypical processing of ToM in autism, implicating the underconnectivity between frontal regions and more posterior areas.},

The main issues identified are the cost of the current available ELNs, their ease of use (or lack of it) and their accessibility issues across different devices and operating systems. Evidence suggests that whilst scientists willingly make use of generic notebooking software, spreadsheets and other general office and scientific tools to aid their work, current ELNs are lacking in the required functionality to meet the needs of the researchers. In this paper we present our extensive research and user study results to propose an ELN built upon a pre-existing cloud notebook platform that makes use of accessible popular scientific software and semantic web technologies to help overcome the identified barriers to adoption.},

The neuroconstructivist approach differs in several respects: (i) it seeks more indirect, lower-level causes of abnormality than impaired cognitive modules; (ii)modules are thought to emerge from a developmental process of modularization; (iii) unlike empiricism, neuroconstructivism accepts some form of innately specified starting points, but unlike nativism, these are considered to be initially `domain-relevant', only becoming domain-specific with the process of development and specific environmental interactions; and (iv) different cognitive disorders are considered to lie on a continuum rather than to be truly specific. These alternative theoretical positions are briefly considered as they apply to Specific Language Impairment, and followed by a more detailed case study of a well-defined neurodevelopmental disorder, Williams syndrome. It is argued that development itself plays a crucial role in phenotypical outcomes.},

Object centered deficits such as biased line bisection are due to more posterior (and possibly inferior) injury. Finally, extinction is associated with damage to the temporo-parietal junction. Further, we describe key choices that must be made to parse the spatial and attentional syndromes that result from right hemisphere injury, including the investigation of both acute and chronic injury as well as the use of functional and structural modalities.},

Individual rates of learning, defined as the difference in ratings for words and partwords, were used as predictors of neural activation to ask which brain areas showed activity associated with these measures. Results showed significant activity in the pars opercularis and pars triangularis regions of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG).

Finally, we again assessed participants’ rates of production for the target constructions. Consistent with claims that structural priming is a case of implicit learning, we found that biasing participants toward the prepositional object construction produced stronger cumulative priming effects than did biasing participants toward the double object construction. We also found that individual differences in implicit learning were marginally correlated with overall rates of production for the double object construction. Participants who scored better on the learning task tended to produce fewer double object constructions.},

  abstract = {Modern Hebrew exhibits a non-concatenative morphology of consonantal “roots” and melodic “templates” that is typical of Semitic languages. Even though this kind of non-concatenative morphology is well known, it is only partly understood. In particular, theories differ in what counts as a morpheme: the root, the template, both, or neither. Accordingly, theories differ as to what representations learners must posit and what processes generate the eventual surface forms. In this paper I present a theory of morphology and allomorphy that combines lexical roots with syntactic functional heads, improving on previous analyses of root-and-pattern morphology. Verbal templates are here argued to emerge from the combination of syntactic elements, constrained by the general phonology of the language, rather than from some inherent difference between Semitic morphology and that of other languages. This way of generating morphological structure fleshes out a theory of morphophonological alternations that are non-adjacent on the surface but are local underlyingly; with these tools it is possible to identify where lexical exceptionality shows its effects and how it is reined in by the grammar. The Semitic root is thus analogous to lexical roots in other languages, storing idiosyncratic phonological and semantic information but respecting the syntactic structure in which it is embedded.},

Within the group of alphabetic orthographies itself, there are varying degrees of dependence on the strict alphabetic principle: the range of correspondence between grapheme and phoneme varies both in consistency and completeness. The degree of this dependence is to some extent a function of a language's characteristic phonology and morphology, just as was the choice of the kind of orthography itself. Even among the various alphabetic writing systems themselves, there are major differences in the degree to which they mirror the phonemic structure of their respective spoken languages. The reason for the differences is largely accounted for by the particular phonological and morphological characteristics of each language. For example, standard written Hebrew is an orthography in which all diacritics (or points) are omitted. These diacritics represent nearly all of the vowels and are also used to disambiguate some of the consonants.},

The present study is aimed at differentiating and discussing the relative contribution of these aspects with a main focus on syntactic and morphological processing. Experiment 1 established a processing advantage for nouns in German visual lexical decision, using nouns denoting biological and man-made objects as compared to transitive and intransitive verbs. Experiment 2 showed that the noun advantage persisted even when the morphological differences between word categories were reduced by using identical suffixes in nouns and verbs. Overall results suggest that the processing differences cannot be reduced to variables such as frequency, word form, or morphological complexity. Reaction time differences between transitive and intransitive verbs strengthen the role of syntactic information. In line with previous accounts the observed effects are discussed in terms of a category-specific combination of linguistic parameters.

The ‘relativist’ position holds that the correct answer to both questions is Yes, based on data from the Berinmo language of Papua New Guinea. It is shown here that the Berinmo facts instead support a more complex view – that cross-language color naming follows non-trivial universal tendencies, while cross-language color-naming differences do indeed correlate with differences in color cognition. The rhetoric of ‘relativity’ versus ‘universalism’ impedes understanding of cross-language color naming and cognition.},

These constraints arise from the structure and function of the visual system. Thus in the case of color at least, rather than language determining perception (cf. Sapir and Whorf), it is perception that determines language. In deriving the semantic universals from properties of the visual system, one must employ a continuous rather than discrete mathematics, in particular the theory of fuzzy sets. The resulting model of color semantics thus conflicts with the discrete-feature concept of semantic primes shared by structuralists and generativists. It is argued on this basis that discrete-feature semantic theories are of limited accuracy.},

The purpose of the present study was to model individual differences in polymorphemic word recognition ability at the item level among 5th-grade children (N = 173) oversampled for children with RD using item-response crossed random-effects models. We distinguish between two subtypes of RD children with word recognition problems, those with early-emerging RD and late-emerging RD. An extensive set of predictors representing item-specific knowledge, child-level characteristics, and word-level characteristics were used to predict item-level variance in polymorphemic word recognition. Results indicate that item-specific root word recognition and word familiarity; child-level RD status, morphological awareness, and orthographic choice; word-level frequency and root word family size; and the interactions between morphological awareness and RD status and root word recognition and root transparency predicted individual differences in polymorphemic word recognition item performance. Results are interpreted within a multisource individual difference model of polymorphemic word recognition skill spanning item-specific, child-level, and word-level knowledge.},

What is the nature of mental representations? Is there an effect of morphological relatedness in the priming of complex words? What are the contents of the mental lexicon? A visual lexical decision task within a morphological priming paradigm was used, probing the Ss' word recognition of simple and of regularly and irregularly inflected verbs. The results obtained confirm the importance of morphemic relatedness in each of the two languages. They also point towards a significant language-specific effect with respect to the identification of the basic priming unit and the basic unit of representation.

This paper shows how insights from linguistic typology can provide cognitive neuroscientists with well-motivated guidelines for interpreting the extant data and charting a future course. At the outset, a fundamental distinction is made between universal and language-particular aspects of word classes. Regarding universals, prototypical nouns involve reference to objects, and their meanings rely primarily on the ventral temporal lobes, which represent the shape features of entities; in contrast, prototypical verbs involve predication of actions, and their meanings rely primarily on posterior middle temporal regions and frontoparietal regions, which represent the visual motion features and somatomotor features of events. Some researchers maintain that focusing on object nouns and action verbs is inappropriate because it conflates the semantic and grammatical properties of each word class. However, this criticism not only ignores the importance of the universal prototypes, but also mistakenly assumes that there are straightforward morphological and/or syntactic criteria for identifying nouns and verbs in particular languages. In fact, at the level of individual languages, the classic method of distributional analysis leads to a proliferation of constructionally based entity-denoting and event-denoting word classes with mismatching memberships, and all of this variation must be taken seriously, not only by linguists, but also by cognitive neuroscientists. Many of these word classes involve remarkably close correspondences between grammar and meaning and hence are highly relevant to the neurobiology of conceptual knowledge, but so far hardly any of them have been investigated from a neurolinguistic perspective.

Reported here are 3 studies that show that 164 children (aged 5-9 yrs) and 41 adults (aged 18-70 yrs) do not usually base their spellings of plural real-word and pseudo-word endings on the morphological rule that all regular plurals are spelled with -s.

Over 4 sessions, participants learned to use adjectives that had to agree in gender with nouns. Learners were then tested on various types of novel nouns.

No priming was found for physically related words. Thus, "deflecting" spoken clearly in pretraining had no effect on identification of "reflecting" in the test phase. There was strong facilitation from a word with a regular inflectional relationship to the test word. Thus, "reflected" facilitated recognition of "reflecting" almost as much as prior experience of "reflecting" itself, and when responses were scored in terms of the root morpheme, the morphemic effect was the same in the 2 cases. That this was a structural and not a semantic effect was shown by the lack of facilitation between irregularly related words such as "held/holding," "man/men," and "lost/loses." Data suggest that there is a morphological/structural level of analysis that is presemantic, at which these long-term facilitation effects take place. They also challenge the cohort theory of word recognition. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).}

Several forms of HARKing are identified and survey data are presented that suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced and widely seen as inappropriate. I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate. To help stimulate such discussion (and for those such as myself who suspect that HARKing's costs do exceed its benefits), I conclude the article with some suggestions for deterring HARKing.},

Adults were found to learn a miniature artificial language better when they were initially presented with only small segments of language than when they were presented immediately with the full complexity of the language. Adults who were presented initially with individual words and only later with complex “sentences” composed of several such words learned the meanings and morphology of those words better than did adults who were presented with sentences throughout learning. The externally imposed constraint of processing only small segments of language is conjectured to be similar to the internal processing constraints of children that have been proposed to aid children in their acquisition of language.},

The current study investigated whether individual differences in statistical learning (SL), which has been implicated in language acquisition, independently predicted 6- to 8-year-old's comprehension of syntax. Sixty-eight (N = 68) English-speaking children completed a test of comprehension of four syntactic structures, a test of SL utilizing nonlinguistic visual stimuli, and several additional control measures. The results revealed that SL independently predicted comprehension of two syntactic structures that show considerable variability in this age range: passives and object relative clauses.

This traditional view has been recently challenged by showing that temporal attention to a target stimulus is a prerequisite for "automatic" response priming. The event-related potential (ERP) study reported here extends this research by pursuing a somewhat different approach. In two experiments, it was investigated whether masked semantic priming effects can be modulated by temporal attention to the prime using a cueing procedure. We hypothesized that masked priming is amplified when attention is directed to the stimulus stream in the time window of masked prime presentation, even in the absence of any prime awareness. ERPs were recorded while subjects performed a primed lexical decision task. Target words were preceded by semantically related or unrelated masked prime words, which were not consciously identified. A cue stimulus prompted subjects to direct their attention to the stimulus stream either shortly before the masked prime (short cue interval) or a long time interval before. Priming affected the amplitude of the N400 ERP component, an electrophysiological index of semantic processing. Unrelated prime–target pairs elicited a larger N400 than related pairs (N400 priming effect). Most importantly, this masked N400 priming effect was strongest when the cue interval and the stimulus onset asynchronies were short. The present results show that temporal attention to the prime is a prerequisite for obtaining masked N400 priming effects. They also demonstrate that unconscious automatic processes are susceptible to attentional modulation.},

  abstract = {Digital writing devices associated with the use of computers, tablet PCs, or mobile phones are increasingly replacing writing by hand. It is, however, controversially discussed how writing modes influence reading and writing performance in children at the start of literacy. On the one hand, the easiness of typing on digital devices may accelerate reading and writing in young children, who have less developed sensory-motor skills. On the other hand, the meaningful coupling between action and perception during handwriting, which establishes sensory-motor memory traces, could facilitate written language acquisition. In order to decide between these theoretical alternatives, for the present study, we developed an intense training program for preschool children attending the German kindergarten with 16 training sessions. Using closely matched letter learning games, eight letters of the German alphabet were trained either by handwriting with a pen on a sheet of paper or by typing on a computer keyboard. Letter recognition, naming, and writing performance as well as word reading and writing performance were assessed. Results did not indicate a superiority of typing training over handwriting training in any of these tasks. In contrast, handwriting training was superior to typing training in word writing, and, as a tendency, in word reading. The results of our study, therefore, support theories of action-perception coupling assuming a facilitatory influence of sensory-motor representations established during handwriting on reading and writing.},

In Exp 1, ERPs were recorded while Ss (aged 18-55 yrs) performed lexical decisions on targets)receded by masked and unmasked primes at an SOA (stimulus onset asynchrony) of 67 msec. Masked words, which were not consciously perceived, as well as visible words were shown to modulate the N400 to meaningfully related target words. Exp 2 required Ss (aged 19-44 yrs) to perform decisions on visual, lexical and semantic features of masked words presented with or without semantically related context words. Ss performed at chance in all tasks. Furthermore, the results exclude the possibility that backward priming has rendered the masked words partially visible.

The alternative hypothesis is that language systematicities are encoded probabilistically in a way that does not categorically distinguish rule-like and irregular forms. In the present study, this matter was investigated more closely by focusing specifically on whether the regular–irregular distinction in English past tenses is categorical or graded. We compared the ERP priming effects of regulars (baked–bake), vowel-change irregulars (sang–sing), and “suffixed” irregulars that display a partial regularity (suffixed irregular verbs, e.g., slept–sleep), as well as forms that are related strictly along formal or semantic dimensions. Participants performed a visual lexical decision task with either visual (Experiment 1) or auditory prime (Experiment 2). Stronger N400 priming effects were observed for regular than vowel-change irregular verbs, whereas suffixed irregulars tended to group with regular verbs. Subsequent analyses decomposed early versus late-going N400 priming, and suggested that differences among forms can be attributed to the orthographic similarity of prime and target. Effects of morphological relatedness were observed in the later-going time period, however, we failed to observe true regular–irregular dissociations in either experiment. The results indicate that morphological effects emerge from the interaction of orthographic, phonological, and semantic overlap between words.},

  abstract = {Most neuroimaging studies examining verb morphology have focused on verb tense, with fewer examining agreement morphology, and no previous fMRI studies have investigated distinctions between past and present tense inflection. However, models of language representation and processing suggest differences in where these inflections are instantiated in the phrase structure as well as differences in the linguistic functions they serve, suggesting unique neural networks for these forms. In addition, results of available neuroimaging studies of grammatical morphology vary considerably due to methodological differences. Some studies have used overt production tasks, whereas others have used covert tasks. In the present study we examined brain activation associated with past tense and present tense/agreement morphology under overt and covert production conditions in 13 healthy adults using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design. Production of verbs inflected for past tense (V~+~-ed) and present tense/agreement (V~+~-s) was elicited using temporal adverbs (i.e. Yesterday, Nowadays). Results showed that in healthy adults inflecting both past tense and agreement morphology (compared to a verb stem production condition) recruited not only left inferior frontal structures, but also motor and premotor cortices, and posterior parietal regions. Activation also was observed in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and the cingulate gyrus. Past tense and present tense/agreement recruited partially overlapping tissue in these regions, with distinctions observed for the two forms in frontal and parietal brain areas. We also found that activation varied with task demands, with more extensive frontal activation noted in the overt compared to the covert verb inflection task. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the neural signatures for verb inflection differ from that for verb stems alone and involve a distributed frontal and parietal network of brain regions. Further, the neural tissue recruited for instantiation of past tense versus present tense/agreement morphology is distinct, supporting linguistic theories that differentiate the two forms.},

Much research on this topic has focused on English past tense morphology, which comprises a regular, rule-like pattern (e.g., bake-baked) and a set of irregular forms that defy a rule-based description (e.g., take-took). Previous studies have used past tense priming to support the theory that the two forms are processed using different cognitive mechanisms. In the present study we investigated this distinction more closely, focusing specifically on whether the regular/irregular distinction is categorical or graded. Priming for regular and irregular forms was compared, as well as for forms that are irregular but display a partial regularity (suffixed irregular verbs, e.g., sleep-slept). Participants performed a lexical decision task with either a masked visual (Experiment 1) or an auditory prime (Experiment 2). We also manipulated prime-target ISI (0 vs. 500 ms), given previous studies indicating this factor might also influence the magnitude and quality of effects. We observed priming effects for both regular and irregular verbs, however the degree of priming of both was influenced by prime modality and processing time. When the prime was masked and presented for 66 ms regulars and suffixed irregulars patterned together, and were different from vowel change irregular forms. As the processing time increased (using longer ISI or cross-modal presentation), all morphologically related words showed facilitation. The results suggest that priming arises as a convergence of orthographic, phonological and semantic overlap that is especially strong for morphologically related words.},

A key point of contention is whether complex forms are decomposed during recognition (e.g., establish + ment), compared to forms that cannot be analyzed into constituent morphemes (e.g., apartment). In the present study, we examined these issues with respect to English derivational morphology by measuring ERP responses during a cross-modal priming lexical decision task. ERP priming effects for semantically and phonologically transparent derived words (government–govern) were compared to those of semantically opaque derived words (apartment–apart) as well as “quasi-regular” items that represent intermediate cases of morphological transparency (dresser–dress). Additional conditions independently manipulated semantic and phonological relatedness in non-derived words (semantics: couch–sofa; phonology: panel–pan). The degree of N400 ERP priming to morphological forms varied depending on the amount of semantic and phonological overlap between word types, rather than respecting a bivariate distinction between derived and opaque forms. Moreover, these effects could not be accounted for by semantic or phonological relatedness alone. The findings support the theory that morphological relatedness is graded rather than absolute, and depend on the joint contribution of form and meaning overlap.},

It is often the goal of such efforts that increased interest in STEM careers should stimulate economic growth and enhance innovation. Scientific and educational organizations recommend that efforts to interest students in STEM majors and careers begin at the middle school level, a time when students are developing their own interests and recognizing their academic strengths. These factors have led scholars to call for instruments that effectively measure interest in STEM classes and careers, particularly for middle school students. In response, we leveraged the social cognitive career theory to develop a survey with subscales in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In this manuscript, we detail the six stages of development of the STEM Career Interest Survey. To investigate the instrument's reliability and psychometric properties, we administered this 44-item survey to over 1,000 middle school students (grades 6–8) who primarily were in rural, high-poverty districts in the southeastern USA. Confirmatory factor analyses indicate that the STEM-CIS is a strong, single factor instrument and also has four strong, discipline-specific subscales, which allow for the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subscales to be administered separately or in combination. This instrument should prove helpful in research, evaluation, and professional development to measure STEM career interest in secondary level students.},

  abstract = {In generative grammar there is a traditional distinction between sentence acceptability, having to do with performance, and sentence grammaticality, having to do with competence. The attempt of this paper is to provide a characterization of the notion ‘acceptable sentence’ in English, with some suggestions as to how this characterization might be made universal. The procedure is to outline a set of procedures which are conjectured to be operative in the assignment of a surface structure tree to an input sentence. To some extent, these principles of parsing are modeled on certain parsing techniques formulated by computer scientists for computer languages. These principles account for the high acceptability of right branching structures, outline the role of grammatical function words in sentence perception, describe what seems to be a fixed limit on short-term memory in linguistic processing, and hypothesize the structure of the internal syntactic processing devices. The operation of various classes of transformations with regard to preparing deep structures for input to parsing procedures such as those outlined in the paper is discussed. Résumé Il existe dans la grammaire générative une distinction traditionnelle entre l'acceptabilité d'une phrase, qui appartient au domaine de la performance, et la grammaticalité d'une phrase, qui appartient au domaine de la compétence. Le but de l'article est de fournir une caractérisation de la notion de ‘phrase acceptable’ en anglais et de suggérer comment cette caractérisation pourrait avoir une portée universelle. La procédure consiste à donner une série de procédures qu'on pense être opérationnelles pour assigner l'arbre de la structure de surface à une phrase d'entrée. Ces principes d'analyse sont partiellement inspirés par les formules utilisées dans les langages d'informatique. Ces principes qui expliquent la grande acceptabilité de structures de dérivation à droite, mettent en évidence le rôle des mots grammatico/fonctionnels dans la perception des phrases, décrivent ce qui semble être une limite fixe de la mémoire à court terme dans le traitement linguistique et permettent de faire l'hypothése sur la structure des mécanismes internes dans le traitement de la syntaxe. Enfin sont discutés les différentes classes de transformation que l'on peut utiliser pour préparer les structures profondes comme input à des procédures d'analyse.},

The global-precedence hypothesis, considered by many as a modern version of the Gestaltist claim about the perceptual primacy of wholes, has generated a large body of research, but the debate still remains very active. This article reviews the research within the global/local paradigm and critically analyzes the assumptions underlyling this paradigm. The extent to which this line of research contributes to understanding the role of wholistic processing on object perception is discussed. It is concluded that one should be very cautious in making inferences about wholistic processing from the processing advantage of the global level of stimulus structure. A distinction is proposed between global properties, defined by their position in the hierarchical structure of the stimulus, and wholistic properties, defined as a function of interrelations among component parts. It is suggested that a direct comparison between processing of wholistic and component properties is needed to support the hypothesis about the perceptual primacy of wholistic processing.

  abstract = {Are difficulties of individuals with dyslexia (IDDs) reduced or enhanced in tasks where linguistic regularities typically facilitate performance, such as vocabulary acquisition and reading? If impaired short-term memory and poor phonological decoding pose the main impediments to IDDs, then they are expected to compensate for these difficulties with a greater reliance on linguistic regularities, to reduce online load. However, if reduced benefits from regularities pose the main bottleneck, IDDs might benefit less than good readers from regularities in spite of their online difficulties. To test that, we administered two experiments. In a novel paradigm of auditory vocabulary acquisition in Hebrew, novel words were presented either with or without familiar morphological structure. Participants with dyslexia showed a reduced recall benefit from familiar structure as compared with controls. However, their recognition was facilitated by morphological structure and did not significantly differ from controls’. In the second experiment, participants read novel words with and without familiar structure. Benefit from structure familiarity for IDDs was significantly smaller than for controls, in spite of IDDs’ greater potential benefit from familiar structure due to their reduced overall accuracy. However, when asked to emphasize speed in reading, structure familiarity was found to be beneficial for IDDs, without compromising accuracy. These results imply that accumulative acquisition of sublexical regularities is less efficient in dyslexia, though in some tasks this knowledge is accessible and beneficial.

Sixty participants read sentences, and ERP effects of semantic anomaly, relative to plausible words, were calculated for each participant. Results suggested qualitatively different ERP patterns across participants: Some individuals generated N400-dominated effects, whereas others generated P600-dominated effects, for the same stimuli. To specify the sources of individual differences in brain responses, we also derived aggregate scores for verbal working memory (WM), nonverbal WM, and language experience/knowledge, based on 6 behavioral measures administered to each participant. Multiple regression analysis pitting these 3 constructs against each other showed that a larger verbal WM capacity was significantly associated with larger P600 and smaller N400 effect amplitudes across individuals, whereas the other constructs did not predict the ERP effects. The results suggest that N400 and P600 brain responses, which may be attributable to semantic integration difficulty and structural processing, respectively, vie for expression when comprehenders encounter semantically unexpected words and that which option wins out is constrained in part by each comprehender’s verbal WM capacity.

CISs thus seem to be like adults': IR forms are tied to the lexicon but regular forms are computed by a default rule, and words are represented as morphological tree structures reflecting their derivation from basic word roots. Such structures, which determine how novel complex words are derived and interpreted, also govern whether words with IR sound patterns will be regularized. Results suggest that morphological structure and a distinction between mechanisms for regular and IR inflection may be inherent to the design of children's language systems.

We exposed participants to a stream of stimuli, then tested them immediately after, or 24h after, exposure, with separate tests meant to measure implicit and explicit knowledge. To measure implicit learning, we analyzed reaction times during a rapid serial visual presentation detection task; for explicit learning, we used a matching questionnaire. Subjects’ reaction time performance indicated that they did implicitly learn the exposed sequences, and furthermore, this learning was unrelated to explicit learning. These learning effects were observed both immediately after exposure and after a 24-h delay. These experiments offer concrete evidence that statistical learning is long-term and that the learning involves implicit learning mechanisms.},

We argue that a major advance is now possible owing to the application of pattern classifiers to time-resolved recordings of brain activity [electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or intracranial recordings]. By testing at which moment a specific mental content becomes decodable in brain activity, we can characterize the time course of cognitive codes. Most importantly, the manner in which the trained classifiers generalize across time, and from one experimental condition to another, sheds light on the temporal organization of information-processing stages. A repertoire of canonical dynamical patterns is observed across various experiments and brain regions. This method thus provides a novel way to understand how mental representations are manipulated and transformed.},

It is suggested that the absence of an interaction between masked repetition and frequency observed in previous studies and in the present Experiment 1 was due to the fact that very-low-frequency words often have an unstable representation in the subjects’ lexicon and, consequently, sometimes fail to produce repetition priming effects in full.},

This asymmetric frequency-blocking effect contrasts with the symmetric pattern (both a speedup for hard items and a slowdown for easy items when they are mixed together) observed with the naming task. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism responsible for the asymmetric blocking effect in the LDT within a model of blocking effect proposed by Mozer, Kinoshita, and Davis (2003), termed theadaptation-to-the-statistics-of- the environment (ASE) model. Experiments 1A and 1B showed that when the same high- and low-frequency words were used, consistent with the existing literature, an asymmetric blocking effect was found in the LDT and a symmetric blocking effect was found in the naming task. Within the ASE model, a symmetric versus asymmetric blocking effect can be explained in terms of different asymptotic rates in subjective estimates of error probability. Experiments 2 and 3 tested and confirmed a prediction of the model based on this assumption that a speedup of hard items would be observed in an LDT with hard items whose subjective error probability asymptotes near zero (low-frequency words with high familiarity ratings that subjects could be certain were words). Implications of the model for task differences in reaction times are discussed.},

Recently, however, evidence has emerged that by 8 months, infants can extract statistical patterns in auditory input that are based on transitional probabilities defining the sequencing of the input's components (Science 274 (1996) 1926). This finding suggests powerful learning mechanisms that are functional in infancy, and raises questions about the domain generality of such mechanisms. We habituated 2-, 5-, and 8-month-old infants to sequences of discrete visual stimuli whose ordering followed a statistically predictable pattern. The infants subsequently viewed the familiar pattern alternating with a novel sequence of identical stimulus components, and exhibited significantly greater interest in the novel sequence at all ages. These results provide support for the likelihood of domain general statistical learning in infancy, and imply that mechanisms designed to detect structure inherent in the environment may play an important role in cognitive development.},

Since this view encounters numerous difficulties already analyzed in previous studies, an alternative view is presented here that regards cortical control of behavior as a repetitive sensorimotor cycle consisting of two phases: (i) feedforward anticipation and (ii) feedback cortical performance. This view allows us to interpret in an integrative manner numerous data obtained from very different domains of ERP studies: from biophysics of ERP waves to their relationship to the processing of language, in which verbal behavior is viewed as likewise controlled by the same two basic control processes: feedforward (hypothesis building) and feedback (hypothesis checking). The proposed approach is intentionally simplified, explaining numerous effects on the basis of few assumptions and relating several levels of analysis: neurophysiology, macroelectrical processes (i.e. ERPs), cognition and behavior. It can, therefore, be regarded as a first approximation to a general theory of ERPs.},

  abstract = {The present study sought to determine whether semantic satiation is merely a by-product of adaptation or satiation of upstream, nonsemantic perceptual processes or whether the effect can have a locus in semantic memory. This was done by measuring event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in a semantic word-detection task involving multiple presentations of primes and critical related and unrelated words in 3 experiments involving visual (Exp 1) and auditory (Exp 2A and 2B) stimuli. Primes varied in their type case (Exp 1) or pitch (Exp 2B) in order to discourage sensory adaptation. Prime satiation and relatedness of the primes to the critical word had interacting effects on ERP amplitude to critical words, particularly within the time-window of the N400 component. Because numerous studies have indicated a role for the N400 in semantic processing, modulation of the N400 relatedness effect by prime satiation (with little or no contribution from perceptual adaptation) suggests that semantic memory can be directly satiated, rather than the cost to semantic processing necessarily resulting from impoverishment of perceptual inputs.

Relative to nonviolated sentences, the pragmatic anomalies were associated with an increased hemodynamic response in left temporal and inferior frontal regions and a decreased response in the right medial parietal cortex. Relative to nonviolated sentences, the morphosyntactic anomalies were associated with an increased response in bilateral medial and lateral parietal regions and a decreased response in left temporal and inferior frontal regions.

In 'thematic role animacy violations' (e.g. "For breakfast the eggs would only eat..."). the NP was inanimate ("eggs") and was therefore more likely to occupy the role of 'theme' than 'agent', i.e. eggs, being inanimate, cannot eat but they can be eaten.

  abstract = {Recent event-related potential studies report a P600 effect to incongruous verbs preceded by semantically associated inanimate noun–phrase (NP) arguments, e.g., “eat” in “At breakfast the eggs would eat…”. This P600 effect may reflect the processing cost incurred when semantic–thematic relationships between critical verbs and their preceding NP argument(s) bias towards different interpretations to those dictated by their sentences’ syntactic structures. We have termed such violations of alternative thematic roles, ‘thematic role violations.’ Semantic–thematic relationships are influenced both by semantic associations and by more basic semantic features, such as a noun’s animacy. This study determined whether a P600 effect can be evoked by verbs whose thematic structures are violated by their preceding inanimate NP arguments, even in the absence of close semantic–associative relationships with these arguments or their preceding contexts. ERPs were measured to verbs under four conditions: (1) non-violated (“At breakfast the boys would eat…”); (2) preceded by introductory clauses and animate NPs that violated their pragmatic expectations but not their thematic structures (“At breakfast the boys would plant…”); (3) preceded by semantically related contexts but inanimate NPs that violated their thematic structures (“At breakfast the eggs would eat…”); (4) preceded by semantically unrelated contexts and inanimate NPs that also violated their thematic structures (“At breakfast the eggs would plant…”). Pragmatically non-thematic role violated verbs preceded by unrelated contexts and animate NPs evoked robust N400 effects and small P600 effects. Thematically violated verbs preceded by inanimate argument NPs evoked robust P600 effects but no N400 effects, regardless of whether these inanimate arguments or their preceding contexts were semantically related or unrelated to these verbs. These findings suggest that semantic-thematic relations, related to animacy constraints on verbs’ arguments, are computed online and can immediately impact verb processing within active, English sentences.},

Novel metaphors were unfamiliar and harder to interpret. Using a sensicality judgment task, we compared ERPs elicited by the same target word when it was used to end anomalous, novel metaphorical, conventional metaphorical and literal sentences. Amplitudes of the N400 ERP component (320–440~ms) were more negative for anomalous sentences, novel metaphors, and conventional metaphors compared with literal sentences. Within a later window (440–560~ms), ERPs associated with conventional metaphors converged to the same level as literal sentences while the novel metaphors stayed anomalous throughout. The reported results were compatible with models assuming an initial stage for metaphor mappings from one concept to another and that these mappings are cognitively taxing.},

EEG was collected from participants who viewed items varying in number and frequency of both orthographic neighbors and lexical associates. Regression analysis of single item ERPs replicated past findings, showing that N400 amplitudes are greater for items with more neighbors, and further revealed that N400 amplitudes increase for items with more lexical associates and with higher frequency neighbors or associates. Together, the data suggest that in the N400 time window semantic features of items broadly related to inputs are active, consistent with models in which semantic access takes place in parallel with stimulus recognition.},

The study also assessed the advantages of aiding the extraction of specific ERP components by means of signal decomposition using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Methods: 'Go‚Äìnogo' task stimuli were presented either during fMRI scanning or in the gaps between fMRI scans, resulting in ‚Äògradient‚Äô and 'no-gradient' ERPs. 'Go‚Äìnogo' differences in the N2 and P3 components were subjected to conventional ERP analysis, as well as single-trial and reliability analyses. Results: Comparable N2 and P3 enhancement on 'nogo' trials was found in the 'gradient' and 'no-gradient' ERPs. ICA-based signal decomposition resulted in better validity (as indicated by topography), greater stability and lower measurement error of the predicted ERP effects. Conclusions: While there was little or no benefit of acquiring ERPs in the gaps between fMRI scans, ICA decomposition did improve the detection of experimental ERP modulations. Significance: Simultaneous and continuous EEG‚ÄìfMRI acquisition is preferable to interleaved protocols. ICA-based decomposition is useful not only for artifact cancellation, but also for the extraction of specific ERP components.

  abstract = {In human electrophysiology, a considerable corpus of studies using event-related potentials have investigated inhibitory processes by employing the 'go-nogo' paradigm, which requires responding to one type of event while withholding the response to another type of event. Two event-related potential waveform features (N2 and P3) have been associated with larger amplitude in nogo trials than in go trials. Traditionally, these differences were thought to reflect response inhibition. Recently, the source localization of N2 to the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the colocalization of N2 with error-related negativity, has been interpreted in terms of conflict monitoring. In order to isolate the contribution of inhibitory processes, we matched the frequency of the go and nogo events, thus minimizing differences in response conflict between event types. A data-driven analytical procedure contrasted go with nogo events across the entire event-related potential segment and found that N2 reliably differentiated between the two conditions while P3 did not. Tomographical analyses of the N2 difference observed in conditions of equal go and nogo trial frequency localized N2 to the right ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Because a growing body of evidence implicates these brain regions in inhibitory processes, we conclude that N2 does, at least in part, reflect inhibition.

  abstract = {One important debate in psycholinguistics concerns the nature of morphological decomposition processes in visual word recognition (e.g., darkness = \{dark\} + \{-ness\}). One theory claims that these processes arise during orthographic analysis and prior to accessing meaning (Rastle \& Davis, 2008), and another argues that these processes arise through greater temporal overlap between the activation of orthographic and semantic information (Feldman, O'Connor, \& Moscoso del Prado Mart√≠n, 2009). This issue has been the subject of intense debate in studies using masked priming but has yet to be resolved unequivocally. The present study takes another approach to resolving this controversy by examining brain potentials as participants made lexical decisions to unprimed morphological (darkness), pseudomorphological (corner), and nonmorphological (brothel) stimuli. Results revealed a difference from ‚àº190 ms between the nonmorphological condition and the other 2 conditions (which showed no differentiation), a likely correlate of morphological processing reliant exclusively on orthography. Only 60‚Äì70 ms later was there evidence of the activation of semantic information, when the pseudomorphological condition diverged from the other 2 conditions. These results provide unambiguous support for a hierarchical model of morphological processing whereby decomposition is based initially on orthographic analysis and is only later constrained by semantic information.

However, neuroscience programs at PUIs may be deterred from incorporating EEG methods into their research programs and/or classrooms due to limited funds and resources. This article provides recommended guidelines for faculty researchers looking to set up an EEG lab at their host PUIs with an emphasis on feasibility. We offer considerations regarding infrastructure, equipment, personnel, and potential sources of funding. A case study is also provided, describing the successful implementation and development of an EEG/ERP lab at a Midwest PUI, Baldwin Wallace University. Our goal is to offer diverse options for starting a new, or revitalizing an existing, EEG lab. We contend that such a laboratory at a PUI will advance undergraduate students’ access to interdisciplinary neuroscience research and curricular opportunities.},

  abstract = {Many evaluations of cognitive models rely on data that have been averaged or aggregated across all experimental subjects, and so fail to consider the possibility of important individual differences between subjects. Other evaluations are done at the single-subject level, and so fail to benefit from the reduction of noise that data averaging or aggregation potentially provides. To overcome these weaknesses, we have developed a general approach to modeling individual differences using families of cognitive models in which different groups of subjects are identified as having different psychological behavior. Separate models with separate parameterizations are applied to each group of subjects, and Bayesian model selection is used to determine the appropriate number of groups. We evaluate this individual differences approach in a simulation study and show that it is superior in terms of the key modeling goals of prediction and understanding. We also provide two practical demonstrations of the approach, one using the ALCOVE model of category learning with data from four previously analyzed category learning experiments, the other using multidimensional scaling representational models with previously analyzed similarity data for colors. In both demonstrations, meaningful individual differences are found and the psychological models are able to account for this variation through interpretable differences in parameterization. The results highlight the potential of extending cognitive models to consider individual differences.},

  abstract = {The temporal dynamics of processing morphologically complex words was investigated by recording event-related brain potentials (ERPs) when native Finnish-speakers performed a visual lexical decision task. Behaviorally, there is evidence that recognition of inflected nouns elicits a processing cost (i.e., longer reaction times and higher error rates) in comparison to matched monomorphemic words. We aimed to reveal whether the processing cost stems from decomposition at the early visual word form level or from re-composition at the later semantic-syntactic level. The ERPs showed no early effects for morphology, but revealed an interaction with word frequency at a late N400-type component, as well as a late positive component that was larger for inflected words. These results suggest that the processing cost stems mainly from the semantic-syntactic level. We also studied the features of the morphological decomposition route by investigating the recognition of pseudowords carrying real morphemes. The results showed no differences between inflected vs. uninflected pseudowords with a false stem, but differences in relation to those with a real stem, suggesting that a recognizable stem is needed to initiate the decomposition route.

The participants were presented with visual sentences containing critical words in which either inflectional, derivational or both rules (combined violation) of Finnish were violated. Inflectional anomalies violated a number agreement of a noun with a previous auxiliary word. Derivational violations included a word-internal selectional restriction violation, i.e., a root and suffix category violation. Combined violations contained both a number and a category violation. The phonemic length of the critical words was controlled. Inflectional violations elicited a bilateral negative effect in the 450–550~ms time window, which was interpreted as an anterior negativity (AN) effect. Inflectional violations also elicited a late positivity (P600) effect. Derivational violations elicited an N400-like negativity effect, followed by the P600 effect. The P600 effects in the derivational and inflectional violation conditions summated linearly in the combined violation condition. The results are discussed with respect to the hypothesis that inflectional and derivational processes are independent and elicited in parallel in the online language comprehension.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate how the input modality affects the processing of a morphologically complex word. The processing of Finnish inflected vs. monomorphemic words and pseudowords was examined during a lexical decision task, using behavioral responses and event-related potentials. The stimuli were presented in two modalities, visually and auditorily, to two groups of participants. Half of the words and pseudowords carried a case-inflection. At the behavioral level, the inflected words elicited a processing cost with longer decision latencies and higher error rates. At the neural level, pseudowords elicited an N400 effect, which was more pronounced in the visual modality. Inflected words elicited an N400 effect in both modalities, which, however, differed in topography and latency. The N400 effect for inflected words most probably reflects access and possible integration of the stem and suffix. The results suggest that the inflectional processing cost stems from the later, lexical-semantic stage of processing in both modalities. The ERP responses to inflected pseudowords did not differ from the ERP responses to monomorphemic pseudowords in either modality, suggesting that combinatorial case-inflection processing requires a real word stem in order to proceed.

Participants were first familiarized with a lexicon of pseudoletter strings, each comprising an affix-like chunk that either followed (Experiment 1) or preceded (Experiment 2) a random character sequence. In the absence of any linguistic information, chunks could be defined only by their statistical properties - similarly to affixes in the real language, chunks occurred frequently and assumed a specific position within strings. In a later testing phase, we found that participants were more likely to attribute a previously unseen string to the familiarization lexicon if it contained an affix, and if the affix appeared in its typical position. Importantly, these findings suggest that readers may chunk words using a general, language-agnostic cognitive mechanism that captures statistical regularities in the learning materials.},

In other words, they are decomposed into their constituents ‘tax’ and ‘-able’ during comprehension (reading or listening), and producing them might also involve on–the–spot combination of these constituents (especially for inflections). However, despite increasing amount of neurocognitive research, the neural mechanisms underlying these processes are still not fully understood. The purpose of this critical review is to offer a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art of the research on the neural mechanisms of morphological processing. In order to take into account all types of complex words, we include findings on inflected, derived, and compound words presented both visually and aurally. More specifically, we cover a wide range of electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG, respectively) as well as structural/functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) studies that focus on morphological processing. We present the findings with respect to the temporal course and localization of morphologically complex word processing. We summarize the observed findings, their interpretations with respect to current psycholinguistic models, and discuss methodological approaches as well as their possible limitations.},

In the current study, we investigated the time course and neural sources of spoken inflected and derived words using simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses. Ten participants (native speakers) listened to inflected, derived, and monomorphemic Finnish words and judged their acceptability. EEG and MEG responses were time-locked to both the stimulus onset and the critical point (suffix onset for complex words, uniqueness point for monomorphemic words). The ERP results showed that inflected words elicited a larger left-lateralized negativity than derived and monomorphemic words approximately 200 ms after the critical point. Source modeling of MEG responses showed one bilateral source in the superior temporal area ∼100 ms after the critical point, with derived words eliciting stronger source amplitudes than inflected and monomorphemic words in the right hemisphere. Source modeling also showed two sources in the temporal cortex approximately 200 ms after the critical point. There, inflected words showed a more systematic pattern in source locations and elicited temporally distinct source activity in comparison to the derived word condition. The current results provide electrophysiological evidence for at least partially distinct cortical processing of spoken inflected and derived words. In general, the results support models of morphological processing stating that during the recognition of inflected words, the constituent morphemes are accessed separately. With regard to derived words, stem and suffix morphemes might be at least initially activated along with the whole word representation.

This mechanism appears to occur through activation of a population of action-coding cells known as mirror neurons (MN). In the adult motor cortex, performing actions and observing human movement reduces the magnitude of the mu (8–13~Hz) rhythm, possibly reflecting MN system activity. Despite the wealth of information available regarding the adult MN system, little is known about its existence in children. Here, we used EEG to probe mu rhythm modulation in 15 children during observation and execution of hand actions. Our data show that mu rhythm attenuation occurs in children under 11~years old during observation of hand movements. Similarly to what has been reported in adults, observation of goal/object-orientated movement produces greater modulation of the mu rhythm than intransitive movement. These data confirm the existence of an observation–execution matching system in the immature human brain and may be of clinical value in the understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with a faulty MN system, such as autism spectrum disorder.},

If so, changing the motor conditions while children are learning to write by using a method based on typing instead of handwriting should affect their subsequent letter recognition performances. In order to test this hypothesis, we trained two groups of 38 children (aged 3–5 years) to copy letters of the alphabet either by hand or by typing them. After three weeks of learning, we ran two recognition tests, one week apart, to compare the letter recognition performances of the two groups. The results showed that in the older children, the handwriting training gave rise to a better letter recognition than the typing training.},

  abstract = {Fast and accurate visual recognition of single characters is crucial for efficient reading. We explored the possible contribution of writing memory to character recognition processes. We evaluated the ability of adults to discriminate new characters from their mirror images after being taught how to produce the characters either by traditional pen-and-paper writing or with a computer keyboard. After training, we found stronger and longer lasting (several weeks) facilitation in recognizing the orientation of characters that had been written by hand compared to those typed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging recordings indicated that the response mode during learning is associated with distinct pathways during recognition of graphic shapes. Greater activity related to handwriting learning and normal letter identification was observed in several brain regions known to be involved in the execution, imagery, and observation of actions, in particular, the left Broca's area and bilateral inferior parietal lobules. Taken together, these results provide strong arguments in favor of the view that the specific movements memorized when learning how to write participate in the visual recognition of graphic shapes and letters.}

In English, semantic transparency is necessary to produce morphological priming in cross-modal priming, but not as clearly so in masked priming. The available reports of priming effects for opaque prime-target pairs are not as clear-cut as to rule out an explanation in terms of orthographic overlap. Experiment 1 was set out to clarify that issue in French. The novel notion of "pseudo-derivation" we introduce proved useful to show that surface morphology alone can produce priming effects in masked priming. In contrast, pure orthographic overlap produces marginal inhibition. Experiment 2 used auditory-visual cross-modal priming and showed that only semantically transparent words facilitate the recognition of their base.

ERPLAB is closely integrated with EEGLAB, a popular open-source toolbox that provides many EEG preprocessing steps and an excellent user interface design. ERPLAB adds to EEGLAB’s EEG processing functions, providing additional tools for filtering, artifact detection, re-referencing, and sorting of events, among others. ERPLAB also provides robust tools for averaging EEG segments together to create averaged ERPs, for creating difference waves and other recombinations of ERP waveforms through algebraic expressions, for filtering and re-referencing the averaged ERPs, for plotting ERP waveforms and scalp maps, and for quantifying several types of amplitudes and latencies. ERPLAB’s tools can be accessed either from an easy-to-learn graphical user interface or from MATLAB scripts, and a command history function makes it easy for users with no programming experience to write scripts. Consequently, ERPLAB provides both ease of use and virtually unlimited power and flexibility, making it appropriate for the analysis of both simple and complex ERP experiments. Several forms of documentation are available, including a detailed user’s guide, a step-by-step tutorial, a scripting guide, and a set of video-based demonstrations.},

This difference replicates previous results from visual ERP studies and supports the distinction between combinatorial and memory-based processing of morphologically complex words. In addition, LAN/P600 effects were found to be more prominent in the auditory domain than in a previous visual study using similar materials.

This article reviews some of the recent ERP studies of attention, focusing on studies that isolate the operation of attention in specific cognitive subsystems such as perception, working memory, and response selection. Several conclusions are drawn. First, under some conditions attention modulates the initial feedforward volley of neural activity in intermediate visual processing areas. Second, these early effects can be observed for both the voluntary allocation of attention and for the automatic capture of attention following a peripheral visual transient. Third, these effects are present not only when attention is directed to a location in 2-dimensional space, but also when attention is directed to one of two spatially overlapping surfaces. Fourth, attention does not modulate sensory activity unless sensory systems are overloaded; when sensory systems are not taxed, attention may instead operate to influence memory or response processes. That is, attention operates to mitigate information overload in whichever cognitive subsystems are overloaded by a particular combination of stimuli and task.

  abstract = {The vulnerability of statistical learning has been demonstrated in reading difficulties in both the visual and acoustic modalities. We examined segmentation abilities of Hungarian speaking adolescents with different levels of reading fluency in the acoustic verbal and visual nonverbal domains. We applied online target detection tasks, where the extent of learning is reflected in differences between reaction times to predictable versus unpredictable targets. Explicit judgments of well-formedness were also elicited in an offline two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. Learning was evident in both the acoustic verbal and visual nonverbal tasks, both in online and offline measures, but learning effects were larger both in online and offline tasks in the verbal acoustic condition. We haven’t found evidence for a significant relationship between statistical learning and reading fluency in adolescents in either modality. Together with earlier findings, these results suggest that the relationship between reading and statistical learning is dependent on the domain, modality and nature of the statistical learning task, on the reading task, on the age of participants, and on the specific language. The online target detection task is a promising tool which can be adapted to a wider set of tasks to further explore the contribution of statistical learning to reading acquisition in participants from different populations.},

An alternative possibility is that the word recognition process is driven by the activation of grapheme units, that is, that graphemes, rather than letters, are the perceptual units in reading. If so, there must be representational units for multiletter graphemes like CH and PH, which play a key role in this process. We examined this idea in four masked priming experiments. Primes were created by transposing, replacing entirely, or removing one component of either multiletter graphemes or two adjacent letters that each represented a grapheme, using both English and Spanish stimuli. In none of the experiments was there any evidence of differential priming effects depending on whether the two letters being manipulated formed a single grapheme or formed two separate graphemes. These data are most consistent with the idea that multiletter graphemes have no special status at the earliest stages of word processing and, therefore, that word recognition is, indeed, driven by the activation of units for individual letters.

Across two experiments, these items were presented in either oral or written form along with various tests of reading ability, intelligence and phonological awareness. The results indicate that children's recognition of derivational relationships improved with grade-level. As anticipated, there was also a significant association between sensitivity to derivational relatedness and decoding ability which remains significant even when the word pairs were orally presented and even when phonological awareness in taken into account. Both phonological awareness and sensitivity to morphological structure emerge as important factors in decoding skill in the later elementary grades.},

  abstract = {Recent work has suggested that variability in levels of neural activation may be related to behavioral and cognitive performance across a number of domains and may offer information that is not captured by more traditional measures that use the average level of brain activation. We examined the relationship between reading skill in school-aged children and neural activation variability during a functional MRI reading task after taking into account average levels of activity. The reading task involved matching printed and spoken words to pictures of items. Single trial activation estimates were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of children's responses to print and speech stimuli; multiple regression analyses evaluated the relationship between reading skill and trial-by-trial activation variability. The reliability of observed findings from the discovery sample (n = 44; ages 8–11; 18 female) was then confirmed in an independent sample of children (n = 32; ages 8–11; 14 female). Across the two samples, reading skill was positively related to trial-by-trial variability in the activation response to print in the left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis. This relationship held even when accounting for mean levels of activation. This finding suggests that intrasubject variability in trial-by-trial fMRI activation responses to printed words accounts for individual differences in human reading ability that are not fully captured by traditional mean levels of brain activity. Furthermore, this positive relationship between trial-by-trial activation variability and reading skill may provide evidence that neural variability plays a beneficial role during early reading development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recent work has suggested that neural activation variability, or moment-to-moment changes in the engagement of brain regions, is related to individual differences in behavioral and cognitive performance across multiple domains. However, differences in neural activation variability have not yet been evaluated in relation to reading skill. In the current study, we analyzed data from two independent groups of children who performed an fMRI task involving reading and listening to words. Across both samples, reading skill was positively related to trial-by-trial variability in activation to print stimuli in the left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis, even when accounting for the more conventional measure of mean levels of brain activity. This finding suggests that neural variability could be beneficial in developing readers.},

  abstract = {Lexical morphology involves two types of suffixes: inflectional suffixes, which have a grammatical function, and derivational suffixes with a word formation function. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used during processing of Italian derived and inflected words. In the derivational task, subjects were asked to produce nouns derived from verbs and from adjectives (e.g., to observe – observation; kind – kindness). After the presentation of the derived noun, they had to generate the corresponding verb (e.g., failure – to fail: generation task). In the inflectional task, subjects had to produce the past participle of the verb or the plural form of the adjective or the derived noun. Behavioural data were collected in separate sessions in two different conditions. In the first experiment, as in the fMRI study, vocal reaction times (RTs) were measured from the offset of the auditory stimulus to the onset of the participant's response. In the second experiment, run with a different group of participants, RTs were recorded starting from the onset of the auditory stimulus to the onset of the response. The fMRI results showed that, relative to the inflectional task and to a repetition task, the derivational task, but not the verb generation task, brought about an activation of left fronto-parietal regions, documenting a specific involvement of these areas in the processing of derived words. Although less extended, similar activation was found for verb inflection but was absent for noun and adjective plural forms. Analysis of behavioral data indicated that an explanation in terms of task difficulty was unlikely related to the imaging results.},

Ten healthy right-handed participants, Italian native speakers, gave their informed consent to participate in the experiment. Two different tasks were used as a baseline for cognitive subtraction. In the repetition task, participants were asked to silently repeat the presented verb, adjective or noun. In the inflectional task, participants were asked to silently produce the past participle of verbs or the plural form of adjectives and nouns. A left fronto-parietal network was activated when comparing the noun-from-verb and noun-from-adjective derivation tasks both with the repetition and with the inflectional task. The region of activation included the ventrolateral frontal cortex, the inferior parietal lobule and the supramarginal gyrus. The intriguing result was the parietal lobe activation. Since the parietal lobe was active only in deriving nouns both from verbs and adjectives, this result seems to be related to the derivational process per se.},

Errors represented 20\% of the responses overall. Virtually all of the children demonstrated productivity with regular (e.g., good) and irregular patterns (zero-marking, e.g., sit {$>$} sit; vowel-change, e.g., ride {$>$} rid). Overall frequency of errors decreased with age, yet the tendency for certain types of irregularizations increased in the older groups. Analyses across items indicated that all error types were predicted by combinations of item frequency, phonological characteristics of stems and past tense forms, and aspects of phonological past tense "neighborhoods." Contrary to "hybrid" or dual-mechanism models incorporating a phonologically-insensitive default mechanism (e.g., Prasada \& Pinker, 1993), these results suggest that children's productivity with regular and irregular patterns is consistent with a phonologically-based constraint satisfaction system similar to that implemented in connectionist models (Daugherly \& Seidenberg, 1992; Plunkett \& Marchmon, 1991, 1993).

In a first experiment children spelled to dictation regular words and words with unpredictable spelling that contained either a high- or a low-frequency (i.e., typical or atypical) sound-spelling mappings. Children with dyslexia were found to rely on probabilistic cues in writing stimuli with unpredictable spelling to a greater extent than typically developing children. The difficulties of children with dyslexia on words with unpredictable spelling were limited to those containing atypical mappings. In a second experiment children spelled new stimuli, i.e., pseudowords, containing phonological segments with unpredictable mappings. The interaction between lexical knowledge and reliance on probabilistic cues was examined through a lexical priming paradigm in which pseudowords were primed by words containing related typical or atypical sound-to-spelling mappings. In spelling pseudowords children with dyslexia showed sensitivity to probabilistic cues in the phoneme-to-grapheme mapping but lexical priming effects were also found, although to a smaller extent than in typically developing readers. The results suggest that children with dyslexia have a limited orthographic lexicon but are able to extract regularities from the orthographic system and rely on probabilistic cues in spelling words and pseudowords.},

Here we sought to track the time course of this discrimination and to determine how orthographic information–letter position and letter identity–is computed during reading. We used a go/no-go lexical decision task while recording event-related potentials (ERPs). Subjects were presented with single words (go trials) and pseudowords (no-go trials), which varied in orthographic conformation, presenting either a double consonant frequently doubled (i.e., "ss") or never doubled (i.e., "zz") (identity factor); and a position of the double consonant was which either legal or illegal (position factor), in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Words and pseudowords clearly differed as early as 230 msec. At this latency, ERP waveforms were modulated both by the identity and by the position of letters: The fronto-central no-go N2 was the smallest in amplitude and peaked the earliest to pseudowords presenting both an illegal double-letter position and an identity never encountered. At this stage, the two factors showed additive effects, suggesting an independent coding. The factors of identity and position of double letters interacted much later in the process, at the P3 level, around 300-400 msec on frontal and central sites, in line with the lexical decision data obtained in the behavioral study. Overall, these results show that the speed of lexical decision may depend on orthographic information coded independently by the identity and position of letters in a word.

This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis.},

There was clear evidence for morphological decomposition of semantically transparent forms. This was independent of phonological transparency, suggesting that morphemic representations are phonologically abstract. Semantically opaque forms, in contrast, behave like monomorphemic words. Overall, suffixed and prefixed derived words and their stems prime each other through shared morphemes in the lexical entry, except for pairs of suffixed forms, which show a cohort-based interference effect.

This increase has been linked to visual expertise for print, implying a protracted monotonic development. We investigated the development of coarse neural tuning for print by studying children longitudinally before and after learning to read, and comparing them to skilled adults. The coarse N1 tuning, which had been absent in nonreading kindergarten children, emerged in less than 2 years after the same children had mastered basic reading skills in 2nd grade. The N1 became larger for words than symbol strings in every child, and this coarse tuning was stronger for faster readers. Fast brain processes thus specialize rapidly for print when children learn to read, and play an important functional role in the fluency of early reading. Comparing 2nd graders with adults revealed a further decrease of the coarse N1 tuning in adults, presumably reflecting further reading practice. This constitutes a prominent nonlinear development of coarse neurophysiological specialization for print. The maximum tuning in novice readers possibly reflects the high sensitivity of their neural network for visual aspects of print, and a more selective tuning in expert adult readers.},

Although some processes applied to single words in isolation have been demonstrated to interact with other processes related to text (for review see Balota, 1994), investigations of mental processes at the single word level represent a critical component process within reading, and also provide scientifically pragmatic paradigms for examining sub-processes involved, from processing the visual forms of words to accessing linguistic representations of phonology and semantics.},

  abstract = {The N170 component of the event-related potential (ERP) reflects experience-dependent neural changes in several forms of visual expertise, including expertise for visual words. Readers skilled in writing systems that link characters to phonemes (i.e., alphabetic writing) typically produce a left-lateralized N170 to visual word forms. This study examined the N170 in three Japanese scripts that link characters to larger phonological units. Participants were monolingual English speakers (EL1) and native Japanese speakers (JL1) who were also proficient in English. ERPs were collected using a 129-channel array, as participants performed a series of experiments viewing words or novel control stimuli in a repetition detection task. The N170 was strongly left-lateralized for all three Japanese scripts (including logographic Kanji characters) in JL1 participants, but bilateral in EL1 participants viewing these same stimuli. This demonstrates that left-lateralization of the N170 is dependent on specific reading expertise and is not limited to alphabetic scripts. Additional contrasts within the moraic Katakana script revealed equivalent N170 responses in JL1 speakers for familiar Katakana words and for Kanji words transcribed into novel Katakana words, suggesting that the N170 expertise effect is driven by script familiarity rather than familiarity with particular visual word forms. Finally, for English words and novel symbol string stimuli, both EL1 and JL1 subjects produced equivalent responses for the novel symbols, and more left-lateralized N170 responses for the English words, indicating that such effects are not limited to the first language. Taken together, these cross-linguistic results suggest that similar neural processes underlie visual expertise for print in very different writing systems.},

So far, this claim has been tested only with respect to low-frequency primes and non word primes. This is a limitation because some models of morphological processing postulate that only high-frequency complex words are recognized as whole forms. Thus, a more stringent test would be to determine whether high-frequency complex words also show evidence of masked priming. We report an experiment that compares masked-priming effects observed when the primes constitute morphologically structured non words (e.g., alarmer‚ÄìALARM), low-frequency words with a mean frequency of 2 per million (e.g., notional‚ÄìNOTION), and high-frequency words with a mean frequency of 60 per million (e.g., national‚ÄìNATION).

If readers treat non-words containing non-productive morphemes as unanalyzed wholes, then these non-words should elicit larger N400s than matched words.

The better decoders were called Phonetics, and the poorer decoders were referred to as Dysphonetics. Single syllable, real word stimuli were used, and both rhyming and non-rhyming targets had a 50\% chance for matching orthography. In the visual paradigm the normal readers exhibited a left frontal contingent negative variation (CNV) before targets, a large reduction in frontal N400 for matching orthography (orthographic priming), and a large reduction in parietal N400 for rhyming targets (phonological priming). Dysphonetics had an intact CNV and orthographic priming, but the group's phonological priming was very reduced. Phonetics showed both orthographic and phonological priming but had a marked reduction in their CNV. In the auditory task, controls showed a left parietal N400 priming effect for rhyming targets. Dysphonetics showed a similar bilateral effect. The Phonetics did not show a normal priming effect, but produced evidence for priming at a longer latency.

  abstract = {Words and pseudowords from high-density orthographic neighborhoods elicit larger amplitude N400s than similar items from low-density orthographic neighborhoods in the lexical decision task. This pattern could be interpreted as an increase in the amount of lexico-semantic information to be processed or as an increase in difficulty identifying a word (or rejecting a pseudoword) amongst many co-activated alternatives. In order to dissociate between these mechanisms, we compared neighborhood effects between a lexical decision task (LDT) and a letter search task (LST). Behaviorally, we found the standard neighborhood and lexicality effects in the LDT, but no significant effects in the LST. Thus, behavioral responses were sensitive to the decisions required by the respective tasks. Electrophysiologically, we found similar N400 neighborhood effects between tasks for words, but the N400 neighborhood effect for pseudowords was only present in the LDT. Moreover, the effect of neighborhood in the LDT occurred earlier for words than for pseudowords. These nuanced differences in the time course and automaticity of word and pseudoword neighborhood effects lend insight into the processes that underlie N400 effects of orthographic neighborhood and how they unfold over time. We propose that the early neighborhood effects for words across tasks were driven by highly automatized word identification processes that were sensitive to the lateral inhibition generated by orthographic neighbors. In contrast, the later neighborhood effects for pseudowords in the LDT could have been driven by task-specific processes tied to how global lexical activity is used to make a lexical decision.},

Our study aimed at casting further light on this domain by investigating the morphological awareness skills of 21 children with dyslexia (mean age 9.10 years old) and 24 children with typical development (mean age 10.3 years old). All children were monolingual speakers of Italian, which is a morphologically rich language characterized by complex inflectional and derivational paradigms. We developed an experimental protocol inspired by Berko’s Wug test and composed of 11 tasks addressing inflectional and derivational processes. Participants were asked to manipulate nonwords of various lexical categories, modeled after the phonotactic structure of Italian, and manipulation involved both word formation and base retrieval. Conditions of the experiments were based on verb conjugation classes differing in frequency, productivity, regularity, and formal transparency. Results confirmed that morphological skills are impaired in dyslexic children, who performed significantly more poorly than their age-matched peers in all tasks. Children with dyslexia were especially challenged by tasks and conditions requiring advanced morphological awareness skills, such as the retrieval of infinitives of infrequent and irregular conjugation classes. The educational and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.},

Experiment 2 investigated the role of long-term consolidation on affix acquisition by comparing knowledge of learned affixes two days and nearly two months after training. Results demonstrated that episodic knowledge of affixes can be acquired shortly after a single training session using either form or semantic learning, but suggested that the development of lexicalized representations of affixes requires the provision of semantic information during learning as well as a substantial period of offline consolidation.

  abstract = {Mental chronometry, in which conclusions about human information processing are reached through measures of subjects' reaction time, has contributed substantially to studies of cognition and action. During the evolution of the chronometric paradigm, several key issues have emerged. The issues concern (a) the existence of separable processing stages, (b) the degree to which various stages of processing produce partial outputs before they are completed, and (c) the discrete versus continuous form of the outputs. To obtain added temporal resolution, new reaction-time procedures have been developed, including special response-priming and speed-accuracy decomposition techniques that focus on quantitative patterns of reaction-time distributions and error rates. The present article summarizes these developments, starting with a historical review of chronometric research and proceeding to a survey of recent empirical and theoretical innovations. We also discuss the relevance and potential future impact of complementary work by cognitive psychophysiologists on event-related brain potentials and other physiological variables.},

By contrast, his ability fo convert print to sound at the segmental level is remarkably spared. He showed no difficulty in reading nonwords and those words to which stress may be assigned on the basis of syllabic structure. In reading aloud words with lexically assigned stress (but not words with syllabically assigned stress), however, CLB produced a large number of segmentally correct, but suprasegmentally incorrect responses (e.g. sabato (Saturday) → /sa'bato/ instead of /'sabato/). Since his ability to use orthographic information in lexical decision and in comprehension tasks was only very mildly impaired, his stress assignment errors would seem to be the result of damage to the phonological output lexicon. This pattern of performance is interpreted as support for the hypothesis that the phonological representations computed in speech production do not merely consist of ordered sequences of phonemes, but consist instead of multidimensional representations that specify (among other things) syllabic structure.},

Relative to the other experimental conditions, the grammatical feature task activated areas of the left middle and inferior frontal gyrus and of the left middle and inferior temporal gyrus. These activations fit in well with neuropsychological studies that document the correlation between left frontal lesions and damage to morphological processes in agrammatism, and the correlation between left temporal lesions and failure to access lexical representations in anomia. Taken together, these data suggest that grammatical gender is processed in a left fronto-temporal network. In addition, the observation that the grammatical feature task and the phonology task activated neighboring but distinct regions of the left frontal lobe provides a plausible neuroanatomical basis for the systematic occurrence of phonological errors in aphasic subjects with morphological deficits.},

We observed a large effect of language that mostly affected amplitudes of the N400 component, but starting as early as 150 ms post-stimulus onset. A similar pattern was found in Experiment 2 with L1 French and L2 English, showing that the effect is due to language dominance and not language per se. Experiment 3 found that proficient French/English bilinguals exhibited a different pattern of language effects showing that these effects are modulated by proficiency. These results lend further support to the hypothesis that word recognition during the early phases of L2 acquisition in late learners of L2 involves a specific set of mechanisms compared with recognition of L1 words.},

Targets that were immediate or delayed repetitions of masked primes resulted in attenuation of the N400, with little or no enhancement of a late positive component (LPC). Delayed, in-the-clear repetitions of unmasked targets led to attenuation of the N400 and enhancement of the LPC.

More typical unmasked repetition effects were observed for immediate repetitions including a larger attenuation of the N400 and enhancement of the LPC.

  abstract = {Considerable individual differences in language ability exist among normally developing children and adults. Whereas past research have attributed such differences to variations in verbal working memory or experience with language, we test the hypothesis that individual differences in statistical learning may be associated with differential language performance. We employ a novel paradigm for studying statistical learning on-line, combining a serial-reaction time task with artificial grammar learning. This task offers insights into both the timecourse of and individual differences in statistical learning. Experiment 1 charts the micro-level trajectory for statistical learning of nonadjacent dependencies and provides an on-line index of individual differences therein. In Experiment 2, these differences are then shown to predict variations in participants\&\#8217; on-line processing of long-distance dependencies involving center-embedded relative clauses. The findings suggest that individual differences in the ability to learn from experience through statistical learning may contribute to variations in linguistic performance.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTAn important question in psycholinguistics is whether or not the semantic transparency of words plays any role during the processing of compound words. Studies of different languages have produced mixed results suggesting that semantic properties of compounding do not have a universal effect. This paper uses masked priming at three different SOAs to study the possible effects of semantic transparency and grammatical class on processing of Persian and Cantonese compounds. We found priming effects in all types of compounds across both languages regardless of semantic transparency and grammatical class. Our findings revealed processing patterns which were unique to each language. We contend that compounding is a complex process influenced by the interactions among the unique properties of each language such as productivity, headedness, and the writing system.}

In this study, the authors used event-related potentials to compare switches between two languages with within-language lexical switches as bilinguals read for comprehension. Stimuli included English sentences and idioms ending either with the expected English words, their Spanish translations (code switches), or English synonyms (lexical switches). As expected, lexical switches specifically enhanced the N400 response in both context types. Code switches, by contrast, elicited an increased negativity over left fronto-central sites in the regular nonidiomatic sentences (250–450 ms) and a large posterior positivity (450–850 ms) in both context types. In addition, both lexical and code switches elicited a late frontal positivity (650–850 ms) relative to expected completions, especially in idioms. Analysis of the individual response patterns showed correlations with vocabulary skills in English and in Spanish. Overall, the electrophysiological data suggest that for some speakers in some contexts, the processing of a code switch may actually be less costly than the processing of an unexpected within-language item.},

The mechanisms by which regularly (walked, birds) and irregularly (gave, geese) inflected forms are processed are less well established. We combine the masked priming paradigm with EEG recording to directly compare the ERPs evoked by regularly and irregularly inflected forms.

Subjects performed a lexical decision task. Behavioural results showed that all prime types significantly facilitated target recognition. Priming effects were reflected in the electrophysiological data by reduced N250 and N400 amplitudes, and these priming effects were statistically equivalent for the three types of prime. The strong priming effects found with simplex primes in the present study, compared with prior research, are thought to be due to the combination of targets always being completely embedded in prime stimuli plus the reduced lexical inhibition that arises with nonword primes. In line with prior behavioural research, however, there was evidence for differential priming effects as a function of prime type in the N400 ERP component in Experiment 2, with greater priming effects for derived and pseudocomplex primes relative to simplex primes at lateral posterior electrode sites.

Using a single-word paradigm, we did not find a LAN for any of the incorrect verb forms but found an N400-like effect for all irregular verbs. In the sentence context, only the incorrect irregulars elicited a long-lasting, broadly distributed late positivity, reminiscent of the P600. For regular verbs, responses to incorrect forms produced smaller, more time restricted effects.

The theory is capable of accounting for results from a variety of models of reaction time distributions and it makes novel predictions. It provides a unified account of known changes in the shape of the distributions depending on properties of the task and of the participants, and it predicts additional changes that should be observed. We show that a number of known properties of \{RT\} distributions are homogeneously accounted for by variations in the value of two easily interpretable parameters, the coefficients of variation of the two normal variables. The predictions of the theory are compared with those of many families of distributions that have been proposed to account for \{RT\}s, indicating our theory provides a significantly better account of the data across tasks and modalities. In addition, a new methodology for analyzing \{RT\} data is derived from the theory, and we illustrate how it can be used to disentagle top-down and bottom-up effects in an experiment. Finally, we show how the theory links to neurobiological models of response latencies.},

Developing readers in Grade 3 and skilled adult readers participated in a reading aloud task in four alphabetic orthographies (English, French, German, Italian), which differ in terms of both orthographic consistency and morphological complexity. English is the least consistent, in terms of its spelling-to-sound relationships, as well as the most morphologically sparse, compared to the other three. Two opposing hypotheses were formulated. If orthographic consistency modulated the use of morphology in reading, readers of English should show more robust morphological processing than readers of the other three languages, because morphological units increase the reliability of spelling-to-sound mappings in the English language. In contrast, if the use of morphology in reading depended on the morphological complexity of a language, readers of French, German, and Italian should process morphological units in printed letter strings more efficiently than readers of English. Both developing and skilled readers of English showed greater morphological processing than readers of the other three languages. These results support the idea that the orthographic consistency of a language, rather than its morphological complexity, influences the extent to which morphology is used during reading. We explain our findings within the remit of extant theories of reading acquisition and outline their theoretical and educational implications.},

Second, does nontarget language activation in L2 processing spread beyond the item itself, to the morphological family of the activated nontarget word? The two behavioural experiments both showed a facilitatory effect of Dutch Family Size, indicating that the morphological family in the L1 is activated regardless of language context. In the two ERP experiments, Family Size effects were found to modulate the N400 component. Less negative waveforms were observed for words with a high L1 Family Size compared to words with a low L1 Family Size in the N400 time window, in both the L1 and L2 task.

The verb (pseudo-verb) of the sentences disagreed in number with the subject noun (pseudo-noun) in 50\% of the sentences. The Ss either read the sentences for an interspersed memory test or made a syntactic judgment after each real-word/pseudo-word sentence. While in the real-word condition a late and widespread positivity resembling a previously described syntactic positive shift was found for the disagreeing verbs, a negativity with an onset latency of about 300 msec was seen for the disagreeing pseudo-verbs. In the pseudo-word conditions no positivity followed the initial negativity. This dissociation of negative and positive waves occurring in response to morphosyntactic mismatches by the pseudo/real-word manipulation suggests that the positive shift is a concomitant of a recomputation routine initiated to account for the number incongruency. This routine is based upon the semantics of the sentence and therefore is not observed in the pseudo-word conditions. The earlier negativity appears to be a more direct index of morphosyntactic incongruency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

It has been claimed that a late positivity (P600 or SPS [syntactic positive shift]) occurring to syntactic violations or ambiguities qualifies as such an effect. The present study compared ERPs elicited by morphosyntactic (case inflection errors), semantic, and orthographic (misspelled words) violations in a group of 20-27 yr old German Ss. All 3 types of violations gave rise to late positivities having the characteristics of the previously described P600/SPS. In an earlier time window, however, semantic violations were associated with a centroparietally distributed N400 component, whereas syntactic violations gave rise to a negativity of smaller amplitude that had a frontocentral distribution. In light of the present results, the view that the P600/SPS as a whole reflects specific syntactic processes appears to be untenable and an alternative interpretation is proposed.

Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 59 scalp sites as 19 Ss (aged 18-28 yrs) read stem forms of regular and irregular verbs from a list of 1152 words; the stem forms were either preceded (5-9 intervening items) by their past tense forms (primed condition) or by past tense forms of unrelated verbs (unprimed condition). The difference between the ERPs to the primed and unprimed stems was taken as a measure of morphological priming. The ERPs to regular verbs were clearly different from those to irregular verbs: the former were associated with an N400 reduction in the primed condition; primed irregular verb stems, however, showed no such effect. Control conditions demonstrated that the N400 modulation for regular verbs cannot be attributed to formal (i.e., phonological or orthographical) priming. These ERP effects indicate that regular verbs serve as more powerful primes for their corresponding stem forms than irregular past tense forms, suggesting that regular (but not irregular) past tense forms may be decomposed into stem plus affix.

Next we present an overview of the studies included in this issue, organized by current issues concerning the role of morphological knowledge in literacy. Collectively, the articles in this issue suggest that students with weaker literacy skills tend to lag behind their peers in morphological knowledge but that all students are likely to benefit from morphological instruction. Morphological interventions hold promise, especially for students who face challenges in language learning and literacy, but additional research is needed to provide a basis for informed decisions about the design of effective morphological interventions.},

  abstract = {Two experiments assessed whether 7-year-old children activate semantic information from sub-word orthography. Children made category decisions to visually-presented words, some of which contained an embedded word (e.g., hip in ship). In Experiment 1 children were slower and less accurate to classify words if they contained an embedded word related in meaning to the category (e.g., slower to reject ship as a ‘body part’ than an ‘animal’), especially when the embedded word was higher in frequency than the carrier word. This demonstrates that young children activate semantic information from sub-word orthographic representations, and that they do so from the relatively early stages of learning to read. Experiment 2 replicated this effect. Furthermore, we observed semantic interference regardless of whether the embedded word shared its pronunciation with the carrier (e.g., the hip in ship) or not (e.g., the crow in crown), and regardless of its position within the carrier, suggesting that interference was not dependent on phonological mediation. These findings show that by 7-years-of age, children have begun to establish an orthographic system that is capable of activating sub-word orthographic patterns, strong enough to connect with meaning, when reading words silently.},

Children were exposed to novel words, and following a 1- or 7-day delay interval, orthographic learning was assessed by asking children to select previously seen novel words from an array of visually and phonologically similar foils. Novel words were exposed either in meaningful text or in isolation, and number of exposures was manipulated with each novel word appearing once, twice, or four times. Learning increased as a function of number of exposures, although some evidence of durable one-trial learning was observed. Context played no role, suggesting that orthographic learning is not dependent on meaning-based information. In general, these findings offer support for the central aspects of Share’s self-teaching hypothesis. However, although we observed a general relation between phonological decoding and orthographic learning, the relation did not hold at an item-by-item level of analysis, suggesting that a strong version of Share’s item-based account is not correct.},

In the first experiment, we present streams of speech in which precisely the same kinds of syllable regularities occur as in our previous studies, except that the patterned relations among syllables occur between non-adjacent syllables (with an intervening syllable that is unrelated). Under these circumstances we do not obtain our previous results: learners are quite poor at acquiring regular relations among non-adjacent syllables, even when the patterns are objectively quite simple. In subsequent experiments we show that learners are, in contrast, quite capable of acquiring patterned relations among non-adjacent segments—both non-adjacent consonants (with an intervening vocalic segment that is unrelated) and non-adjacent vowels (with an intervening consonantal segment that is unrelated). Finally, we discuss why human learners display these strong differences in learning differing types of non-adjacent regularities, and we conclude by suggesting that these contrasts in learnability may account for why human languages display non-adjacent regularities of one type much more widely than non-adjacent regularities of the other type.},

Participants listened to story contexts that described two antecedents, and subsequently read a target sentence with a critical noun phrase that lexically matched one antecedent (‘old’), matched two antecedents (‘ambiguous’), partially matched one antecedent in terms of semantic features (‘partial-match’), or introduced another referent (non-anaphoric, ‘new’). After each target sentence, participants judged whether the noun referred back to an antecedent (i.e., an ‘old/new’ judgment), which was easiest for ambiguous nouns and hardest for partially matching nouns. The noun-elicited N400 ERP component demonstrated initial sensitivity to repetition and semantic overlap, corresponding to repetition and semantic priming effects, respectively. New and partially matching nouns both elicited a subsequent frontal positivity, which suggested that partially matching anaphors may have been processed as new nouns temporarily. ERPs in an even later time window and ERPs time-locked to sentence-final words suggested that new and partially matching nouns had different effects on comprehension, with partially matching nouns incurring additional processing costs up to the end of the sentence. In contrast to the ERP results, the time-frequency results primarily demonstrated sensitivity to noun repetition, and did not differentiate partially matching anaphors from new nouns. In sum, our results show the ERP and time-frequency effects of referent repetition during discourse comprehension, and demonstrate the potentially demanding nature of establishing the anaphoric meaning of a novel noun.},

We used small-voxel functional magnetic resonance imaging to study information encoded in local brain activation patterns elicited by consonant-vowel syllables, and by a control set of noise bursts. First, activation of anterior–lateral superior temporal cortex was seen when controlling for unspecific acoustic processing (syllables versus band-passed noises, in a “classic” subtraction-based design). Second, a classifier algorithm, which was trained and tested iteratively on data from all subjects to discriminate local brain activation patterns, yielded separations of cortical patches discriminative of vowel category versus patches discriminative of stop-consonant category across the entire superior temporal cortex, yet with regional differences in average classification accuracy. Overlap (voxels correctly classifying both speech sound categories) was surprisingly sparse. Third, lending further plausibility to the results, classification of speech–noise differences was generally superior to speech–speech classifications, with the no\textbackslash{} exception of a left anterior region, where speech–speech classification accuracies were significantly better. These data demonstrate that acoustic–phonetic features are encoded in complex yet sparsely overlapping local patterns of neural activity distributed hierarchically across different regions of the auditory cortex. The redundancy apparent in these multiple patterns may partly explain the robustness of phonemic representations.},

  abstract = {Statistical learning is a set of cognitive mechanisms allowing for extracting regularities from the environment and segmenting continuous sensory input into discrete units. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (N~=~25) in conjunction with an artificial language learning paradigm to provide new insight into the neural mechanisms of statistical learning, considering both the online process of extracting statistical regularities and the subsequent offline recognition of learned patterns. Notably, prior fMRI studies on statistical learning have not contrasted neural activation during the learning and recognition experimental phases. Here, we found that learning is supported by the superior temporal gyrus and the anterior cingulate gyrus, while subsequent recognition relied on the left inferior frontal gyrus. Besides, prior studies only assessed the brain response during the recognition of trained words relative to novel nonwords. Hence, a further key goal of this study was to understand how the brain supports recognition of discrete constituents from the continuous input versus recognition of mere statistical structure that is used to build new constituents that are statistically congruent with the ones from the input. Behaviorally, recognition performance indicated that statistically congruent novel tokens were less likely to be endorsed as parts of the familiar environment than discrete constituents. fMRI data showed that the left intraparietal sulcus and angular gyrus support the recognition of old discrete constituents relative to novel statistically congruent items, likely reflecting an additional contribution from memory representations for trained items.},

In both experiments the recognition points for words (the point past which no other lexical item was consistent with the acoustic signal) and deviation points for pseudowords (the point past which no real word is compatible with the acoustic signal) were manipulated. An event-related potentials negativity in the region of the N400 component and reaction time (RT) occurred sooner for items with early than late recognition/deviation points. In experiment 1, early and late words produced N400s and RTs with indistinguishable latencies, while late pseudowords produced faster RTs and earlier N400s than early pseudowords.

  abstract = {Sentences are represented as hierarchical syntactic structures, which have been successfully modeled in sentence processing. In contrast, despite the theoretical agreement on hierarchical syntactic structures within words, words have been argued to be computationally less complex than sentences and implemented by finite-state models as linear strings of morphemes, and even the psychological reality of morphemes has been denied. In this paper, extending the computational models employed in sentence processing to morphological processing, we performed a computational simulation experiment where, given incremental surprisal as a linking hypothesis, five computational models with different representational assumptions were evaluated against human reaction times in visual lexical decision experiments available from the English Lexicon Project (ELP), a “shared task” in the morphological processing literature. The simulation experiment demonstrated that (i) “amorphous” models without morpheme units underperformed relative to “morphous” models, (ii) a computational model with hierarchical syntactic structures, Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG), most accurately explained human reaction times, and (iii) this performance was achieved on top of surface frequency effects. These results strongly suggest that morphological processing tracks morphemes incrementally from left to right and parses them into hierarchical syntactic structures, contrary to “amorphous” and finite-state models of morphological processing.},

Whether syntactic competence should be characterized by abstract hierarchical structures or reduced to surface linear strings has been actively debated, but the nature of morphological competence has been insufficiently appreciated despite the parallel question in the cognitive science literature. In this paper, in order to investigate whether morphological competence should be characterized by abstract hierarchical structures, we conducted a crowdsourced acceptability judgment experiment on morphologically complex words and evaluated five computational models of morphological competence against human acceptability judgments: Character Markov Models (Character), Syllable Markov Models (Syllable), Morpheme Markov Models (Morpheme), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFG). Our psycholinguistic experimentation and computational modeling demonstrated that “morphous” computational models with morpheme units outperformed “amorphous” computational models without morpheme units and, importantly, PCFG with hierarchical structures most accurately explained human acceptability judgments on several evaluation metrics, especially for morphologically complex words with nested morphological structures. Those results strongly suggest that human morphological competence should be characterized by abstract hierarchical structures internally generated by the grammar, not reduced to surface linear strings externally attested in large corpora.},

It is controversial, however, as to whether there is a neural mechanism for direct perception of numerosity or whether numerosity is perceived indirectly via other perceptual properties. In this study, we used a novel regression-based analytic method, which allowed an assessment of the unique contributions of visual properties, including numerosity, to explain visual evoked potentials of participants passively viewing dot arrays. We found that the human brain is uniquely sensitive to numerosity and more sensitive to changes in numerosity than to changes in other visual properties, starting extremely early in the visual stream: 75 ms over a medial occipital site and 180 ms over bilateral occipitoparietal sites. These findings provide strong evidence for the existence of a neural mechanism for rapidly and directly extracting numerosity information in the human visual pathway.},

Two components of the ERP which bear special importance to stimulus evaluation, selective attention, and conscious discrimination in humans are the P300 positivity and N200 negativity, appearing 300 ms and 200 ms post-stimulus, respectively. With the rapid proliferation of high-density EEG methods, and interdisciplinary interest in its application as a prognostic, diagnostic, and investigative tool, an understanding of the underpinnings of P300 and N200 physiology may support its application to both the basic neuroscience and clinical medical settings.

A within-subjects design using 15 musically educated 18-35 yr old adults revealed that linguistic and musical structural incongruities elicited positivities that were statistically indistinguishable in a specified latency range. In contrast, a music-specific ERP component was observed that showed antero-temporal right-hemisphere lateralization.

We revisited the nature and scope of this incremental context effect, adopting a word-level linear mixed-effects modeling approach, with the goal of probing the continuous and incremental effects of semantic and syntactic context on multiple aspects of lexical processing during sentence comprehension (i.e., effects of word frequency and orthographic neighborhood). First, we replicated the classic word-position effect at the single-word level: Open-class words showed reductions in N400 amplitude with increasing word position in semantically congruent sentences only. Importantly, we found that accruing sentence context had separable influences on the effects of frequency and neighborhood on the N400. Word frequency effects were reduced with accumulating semantic context. However, orthographic neighborhood was unaffected by accumulating context, showing robust effects on the N400 across all words, even within congruent sentences. Additionally, we found that N400 amplitudes to closed-class words were reduced with incrementally constraining syntactic context in sentences that provided only syntactic constraints. Taken together, our findings indicate that modeling word-level variability in ERPs reveals mechanisms by which different sources of information simultaneously contribute to the unfolding neural dynamics of comprehension.},

  abstract = {The ability to anticipate forthcoming events has clear evolutionary advantages, and predictive successes or failures often entail significant psychological and physiological consequences. In music perception, the confirmation and violation of expectations are critical to the communication of emotion and aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions, emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence. Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the conditional probability (and information content) of musical notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory expectation without compromising ecological validity. A strong negative correlation was found between the probability of notes predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of expectedness. Our electrophysiological results showed that low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes, elicited a larger (i) negative ERP component at a late time period (400–450~ms), (ii) beta band (14–30~Hz) oscillation over the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization between multiple brain regions. Altogether, the study demonstrated that statistical learning produces information-theoretic descriptions of musical notes that are proportional to their perceived expectedness and are associated with characteristic patterns of neural activity.},

The primary evidence for statistical language learning in word segmentation comes from studies using artificial languages, continuous streams of synthesized syllables that are highly simplified relative to real speech.

In the current experiments, English-learning 8-month-old infants’ ability to track transitional probabilities in fluent infant-directed Italian speech was tested (N = 72). The results suggest that infants are sensitive to transitional probability cues in unfamiliar natural language stimuli, and support the claim that statistical learning is sufficiently robust to support aspects of real-world language acquisition.},

The critical words were presented in 3 different versions to 3 different groups of Ss, as part of a simple sentence, in a word list, and embedded in a story. Three types of verbs were investigated, regulars, irregulars and nonce verbs. Correct regular and irregular participles were compared with incorrect ones. For the nonce verbs, participles with the unexpected - (e)n ending were compared with the expected -t participle forms. ERP responses were very consistent across the 3 versions of the experiment: incorrect irregular participles elicited a left frontotemporal negativity, incorrect regulars produced no differences to the correct ones, and nonce verbs were associated with an N400 component but did not show a difference between expected and unexpected endings. The authors interpret the findings with respect to psycholinguistic models of morphological processing and argue that the brain processes regularly inflected words differently from irregularly inflected ones, the latter by accessing full-form entries stored in memory and the former by a computational process that decomposes complex words into stems and affixes.

In this chapter, we revisit this question from a long-range perspective coupled with some new research. C. A. Perfetti (1985) suggested an answer to this question roughly as follows: Although skilled comprehenders differ from less-skilled comprehenders in a number of ways, at least some of these differences arise from a foundational processing factor: the effectiveness of basic word identification skill. Many--not all--problems in comprehension arose from ineffective lower level processes needed for the identification of words. Rapid and perhaps modular word identification was important for a comprehension system of limited capacity. The question we address here is, roughly, does some part of this idea remain tenable? And what more specific instantiation of the general idea is now possible? In what follows, we first review the background of verbal efficiency theory and then illustrate the concept of lexical quality and the lexical quality hypothesis, the central ideas that link lower and higher level reading processes. Then we summarize experiments on simple meaning judgments.},

Each of these topics has psycholinguistic components that reflect the language foundations of reading.  These foundations lie in two facts: (1) a writing system connects to a linguistic system at one or more levels, meaning that word reading is partially a psycholinguistic process; and (2): reading comprehension shares processes (e.g., parsing) with general language comprehension.  One trend of recent research is the development of models of word identification that rely on single rather than dual mechanisms and their extension to explain reading difficulties.  Another is the conclusion that phonology plays a role in reading that cuts across writing systems.  Reading comprehension research continues to reflect two different traditions, sentence parsing and text comprehension.  Both show increasing influence of general cognitive explanations, as opposed to strictly linguistic explanations, for comprehension phenomena.  Studies of brain activation bring converging evidence on reading processes and provide neuroanatomical correlates of reading problems.  In one area, the acquisition and teaching of reading, advances come from increasing consolidation and practical use of previous research gains.},

High lexical quality includes well-specified and partly redundant representations of form (orthography and phonology) and flexible representations of meaning, allowing for rapid and reliable meaning retrieval. Low-quality representations lead to specific word-related problems in comprehension. Six lines of research on adult readers demonstrate some of the implications of the LQH. First, large-scale correlational results show the general interdependence of comprehension and lexical skill while identifying disassociations that allow focus on comprehension-specific skill. Second, word-level semantic processing studies show comprehension skill differences in the time course of form-meaning confusions. Studies of rare vocabulary learning using event-related potentials (ERPs) show that, third, skilled comprehenders learn new words more effectively and show stronger ERP indicators for memory of the word learning event and, fourth, suggest skill differences in the stability of orthographic representations. Fifth, ERP markers show comprehension skill differences in meaning processing of ordinary words. Finally, in text reading, ERP results demonstrate momentary difficulties for low-skill comprehenders in integrating a word with the prior text. The studies provide evidence that word-level knowledge has consequences for word meaning processes in comprehension.},

We examine these connections in addressing how reading processes adapt to the variety of written language and how writing adapts to language. The first adaptation (reading to writing), as evidenced in behavioral and neuroscience data, is achieved through a universal constraint that language places on writing and through the tuning of reading procedures imposed by specific features of writing systems. Children acquire skill in reading through increasing specialization of procedures tuned to their writing system, while also acquiring more general (universal) procedures that serve language mapping and cognitive control. For the second adaption (writing to language), we present examples from several languages to suggest that writing systems tend to fit their linguistic properties, thus providing adaptive variation in writing-to-language mapping. We suggest that this writing-language fit facilitates the child's learning how his or her writing system works.},

At the brain level, dyslexia is associated with aberrant structure and function, particularly in left hemisphere reading/language networks. The neurocognitive influences on dyslexia are also multifactorial and involve phonological processing deficits as well as weaknesses in other oral language skills and processing speed. We address contextual issues such as how dyslexia manifests across languages and social classes as well as what treatments are best supported.

  abstract = {The authors assessed immediate repetition effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants performed familiarity decisions for written personal names. For immediately repeated familiar names, the authors observed 3 distinct ERP modulations. At 180-220 ms, a posterior N200 effect occurred for names preceded by same-font primes only. In addition, an increased left temporal negativity (N250r, 220-300 ms) and a reduced central-parietal negativity (N400, 300-400 ms) were seen both for same-font and different-font repetitions. In a 2nd experiment, when names were preceded by either their corresponding face or the face of a different celebrity, only the N400 effect was preserved. These findings suggest that the N200, N250r, and N400 effects reflect facilitated processing at font-specific featural, lexical, and semantic levels of processing, respectively.

A common set of primes and targets, ranging in transparency, were embedded among a larger set of words that were either transparent or opaque, forming 2 artificial languages: a morphologically rich language analogous to Hebrew, and a morphologically impoverished language analogous to English. A network was then trained to map orthography to semantics for either language, and then tested for priming. Both languages yielded morphological priming for the more transparent targets, but priming extended to semantically opaque targets only in the rich language. The results suggest that non-semantic morphological priming, is, in fact, compatible with the connectionist approach but that its occurrence is predicted to depend on the degree of morphological richness of the language.

  abstract = {Vision unfolds as an intricate pattern of information processing over time. Studying vision and visual cognition therefore requires precise manipulations of the timing of visual stimulus presentation. Although standard computer display technologies offer great accuracy and precision of visual presentation, their temporal resolution is limited. This limitation stems from the fact that the presentation of rendered stimuli has to wait until the next refresh of the computer screen. We present a novel method for presenting visual stimuli with ultrahigh temporal resolution ({$<$}1 ms) on newly available gaming monitors. The method capitalizes on the G-Sync technology, which allows for presenting stimuli as soon as they have been rendered by the computer’s graphics card, without having to wait for the next screen refresh. We provide software implementations in the three programming languages C++, Python (using PsychoPy2), and Matlab (using Psychtoolbox3). For all implementations, we confirmed the ultrahigh temporal resolution of visual presentation with external measurements by using a photodiode. Moreover, a psychophysical experiment revealed that the ultrahigh temporal resolution impacts on human visual performance. Specifically, observers’ object recognition performance improved over fine-grained increases of object presentation duration in a theoretically predicted way. Taken together, the present study shows that the G-Sync-based presentation method enables researchers to investigate visual processes whose data patterns were concealed by the low temporal resolution of previous technologies. Therefore, this new presentation method may be a valuable tool for experimental psychologists and neuroscientists studying vision and its temporal characteristics.},

  abstract = {Abstract Both regular inflectional patterns (walk-walked) and irregular ones (swing-swung) can be applied productively to novel words (e.g. wug-wugged; spling -splung). Theories of generative phonology attribute both generalisations to rules; connectionist theories attribute both to analogies in a pattern associator network; hybrid theories attribute regular (fully predictable default) generalisations to a rule and irregular generalisations to a rote memory with pattern-associator properties. In three experiments and three simulations, we observe the process of generalising morphological patterns in humans and two-layer connectionist networks. Replicating Bybee and Moder (1983), we find that people's willingness to generalise from existing irregular verbs to novel ones depends on the global similarity between them (e.g. spling is readily inflectable as splung, but nist is not inflectable as nust). In contrast, generalisability of the regular suffix does not appear to depend on similarity to existing regular verbs Regularly suffixed versions of both common-sounding plip and odd-sounding ploamph were reliably produced and highly rated, and the odd-sounding verbs were not rated as having worse past-tense forms, relative to the naturalness of their stems, than common-sounding ones. In contrast, Rumelhart and McClelland's connectionist past-tense model was found to vary strongly in its tendency to supply both irregular and regular inflections to these novel items as a function of their similarity to forms it was trained on, and for the dissimilar forms, successful regular inflection rarely occurred. We suggest that rule-only theories have trouble explaining patterns of irregular generalisations, whereas single-network theories have trouble explaining regular ones; the computational demands of the two kinds of verbs are different, so a modular system is optimal for handling both simultaneously. Evidence from linguistics and psycholinguistics independently calls for such a hybrid, where irregular pain are stored in a memory system that superimposes phonological forms, fostering generalisation by analogy, and regulars are generated by a default suffix concatenation process capable of operating on any verb, regardless of its sound.},

We review the evidence for this claim and argue that neither the neuropsychological nor neuroimaging data are consistent with a cortical region specialized for visual word form representations. Specifically, there are no reported cases of pure alexia who have deficits limited to visual word form processing and damage limited to the left midfusiform. In addition, we present functional imaging data to demonstrate that the so-called VWFA is activated by normal subjects during tasks that do not engage visual word form processing such as naming colors, naming pictures, reading Braille, repeating auditory words, and making manual action responses to pictures of meaningless objects. If the midfusiform region has a single function that underlies all these tasks, then it does not correspond to visual word form processing. On the other hand, if the region participates in several functions as defined by its interactions with other cortical areas, then identifying the neural system sustaining visual word form representations requires identification of the set of regions involved. We conclude that there is no evidence that visual word form representations are subtended by a single patch of neuronal cortex and it is misleading to label the left midfusiform region as the visual word form area.},

The neuronal devices underlying words and concepts are distributed neuronal assemblies reaching into sensory and motor systems of the cortex and, at the cognitive level, information binding in such widely dispersed circuits is mirrored by the sensorimotor grounding of form and meaning of symbols. Recent years have seen the emergence of evidence for similar brain embodiment of syntax. Neurophysiological studies have accumulated support for the linguistic notion of abstract combinatorial rules manifest as functionally discrete neuronal assemblies. Concepts immanent to the theory of abstract automata could be grounded in observations from modern neuroscience, so that it became possible to model abstract pushdown storage – which is critical for building linguistic tree structure representations – as ordered dynamics of memory circuits in the brain. At the same time, neurocomputational research showed how sequence detectors already known from animal brains can be neuronally linked so that they merge into larger functionally discrete units, thereby underpinning abstract rule representations that syntactically bind lexicosemantic classes of morphemes and words into larger meaningful constituents. Specific predictions of brain-based grammar models could be confirmed by neurophysiological and brain imaging experiments using MEG, EEG and fMRI. Neuroscience and neurocomputational research offering perspectives on understanding abstract linguistic mechanisms in terms of neuronal circuits and their interactions therefore point programmatic new ways to future theory-guided experimental investigation of the brain basis of grammar.},

This predicts distinct EEG patterns elicited by words of these 2 classes. To test this prediction, content and function words, together with matched pseudowords, were presented in a lexical decision task (where subjects had to decide whether stimuli were meaningful words or not). Evoked potentials were recorded from 17 electrodes 12 of which were located in close vicinity of the perisylvian cortices. Already 160 msec post stimulus onset, substantial differences in activity patterns distinguish the 2 vocabulary classes. A hemisphere by word class interaction revealed interhemispheric differences for function words but not for content words. Potentials evoked by function words were more negative over the left hemisphere compared to the right. These results evidence that brain mechanisms underlying function and content word processing are different. The following explanation of the data is proposed: content words correspond to neuronal assemblies equally distributed over both hemispheres, while assemblies corresponding to function words are strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere and primarily located in the perisylvian region.},

  abstract = {How long does it take the human mind to grasp the idea when hearing or reading a sentence? Neurophysiological methods looking directly at the time course of brain activity indexes of comprehension are critical for finding the answer to this question. As the dominant cognitive approaches, models of serial/cascaded and parallel processing, make conflicting predictions on the time course of psycholinguistic information access, they can be tested using neurophysiological brain activation recorded in MEG and EEG experiments. Seriality and cascading of lexical, semantic and syntactic processes receives support from late (latency ∼1/2 s) sequential neurophysiological responses, especially N400 and P600. However, parallelism is substantiated by early near-simultaneous brain indexes of a range of psycholinguistic processes, up to the level of semantic access and context integration, emerging already 100–250 ms after critical stimulus information is present. Crucially, however, there are reliable latency differences of 20–50 ms between early cortical area activations reflecting lexical, semantic and syntactic processes, which are left unexplained by current serial and parallel brain models of language. We here offer a mechanistic model grounded in cortical nerve cell circuits that builds upon neuroanatomical and neurophysiological knowledge and explains both near-simultaneous activations and fine-grained delays. A key concept is that of discrete distributed cortical circuits with specific inter-area topographies. The full activation, or ignition, of specifically distributed binding circuits explains the near-simultaneity of early neurophysiological indexes of lexical, syntactic and semantic processing. Activity spreading within circuits determined by between-area conduction delays accounts for comprehension-related regional activation differences in the millisecond range.},

In the research presented here, we investigate what information is used to segment a word into its morphemic constituents and, in particular, whether semantic information plays a role in that segmentation. Participants made visual lexical decisions to stem targets preceded by masked primes sharing (1) a semantically transparent morphological relationship with the target (e.g., cleaner-CLEAN), (2) an apparent morphological relationship but no semantic relationship with the target (e.g., corner-CORN), and (3) a nonmorphological form relationship with the target (e.g., brothel-BROTH). Results showed significant and equivalent masked priming effects in cases in which primes and targets appeared to be morphologically related, and priming in these conditions could be distinguished from nonmorphological form priming. We argue that these findings suggest a level of representation at which apparently complex words are decomposed on the basis of their morpho-orthographic properties.

In this article we argue that the weight of evidence now suggests that the recognition of morphologically complex words begins with a rapid morphemic segmentation based solely on the analysis of orthography. Following a review of this evidence, we discuss the characteristics of this form of decomposition, speculate on what its purpose might be, consider how it might be learned in the developing reader, and describe what is known of its neural bases. Our discussion ends by reflecting on how evidence for semantically based decomposition might be (re)interpreted in the context of the orthographically based form of decomposition that we have described.

  abstract = {Some theories of visual word recognition postulate that there is a level of processing or representation at which morphemes are treated differently from whole words. Support for these theories has been derived from priming experiments in which the recognition of a target word is facilitated by the prior presentation of a morphologically related prime (departure-DEPART). In English, such facilitation could be due to morphological relatedness, or to some combination of the orthographic and semantic relatedness characteristic of derivationally related words. The authors report 2 sets of visual priming experiments in which the morphological, semantic, and orthographic relationships between primes and targets are varied in three SOA conditions. 72 Ss participated in Exp 1 and 74 participated in Exp 2. Ss were aged 18–40 yrs. Results showed that morphological structure plays a significant role in the early visual recognition of English words that is independent of both semantic and orthographic relatedness. Findings are discussed in terms of current approaches to morphological processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Morphological errors in reading aloud (e.g., sexist ‚Üí sexy) are a central feature of the symptom-complex known as deep dyslexia, and have historically been viewed as evidence that representations at some level of the reading system are morphologically structured. However, it has been proposed (Funnell, 1987) that morphological errors in deep dyslexia are not morphological in nature but are actually a type of visual error that arises when a target word that cannot be read aloud (by virtue of its low imageability and/or frequency) is modified to form a visually similar word that can be read aloud (by virtue of its higher imageability and/or frequency). In the work reported here, the deep dyslexic patient DE read aloud lists of genuinely suffixed words (e.g., killer), pseudosuffixed words (e.g., corner), and words with non-morphological embeddings (e.g., cornea). Results revealed that the morphological status of a word had a significant influence on the production of stem errors (i.e., errors that include the stem or pseudostem of the target): genuinely suffixed words yielded more stem errors than pseudosuffixed words or words with non-morphological embeddings. This effect of morphological status could not be attributed to the relative levels of target and stem imageability and/or frequency. We argue that this pattern of data indicates that apparent morphological errors in deep dyslexic reading are genuinely morphological, and discuss the implications of these errors for theories of deep dyslexia.

In this article, I develop the view that learning to appreciate morphological relationships may be a vital part of acquiring a direct mapping between printed words and their meanings, represented in the ventral brain pathway of the reading network. I show that morphology provides an important degree of regularity across this mapping in English, and suggest that this regularity is directly associated with irregularity in the mapping between spelling and sound. I further show that while children in primary school display explicit knowledge of morphological relationships, there is scant evidence they show the rapid morphological analysis of printed words that skilled readers exhibit. These findings suggest that the acquisition of long-term morphological knowledge may be associated with the ongoing development of reading expertise. Implications for reading instruction are discussed.},

  abstract = {This monograph discusses research, theory, and practice relevant to how children learn to read English. After an initial overview of writing systems, the discussion summarizes research from developmental psychology on children's language competency when they enter school and on the nature of early reading development. Subsequent sections review theories of learning to read, the characteristics of children who do not learn to read (i.e., who have developmental dyslexia), research from cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience on skilled reading, and connectionist models of learning to read. The implications of the research findings for learning to read and teaching reading are discussed. Next, the primary methods used to teach reading (phonics and whole language) are summarized. The final section reviews laboratory and classroom studies on teaching reading. From these different sources of evidence, two inescapable conclusions emerge: (a) Mastering the alphabetic principle (that written symbols are associated with phonemes) is essential to becoming proficient in the skill of reading, and (b) methods that teach this principle directly are more effective than those that do not (especially for children who are at risk in some way for having difficulty learning to read). Using whole-language activities to supplement phonics instruction does help make reading fun and meaningful for children, but ultimately, phonics instruction is critically important because it helps beginning readers understand the alphabetic principle and learn new words. Thus, elementary-school teachers who make the alphabetic principle explicit are most effective in helping their students become skilled, independent readers.},

  abstract = {This study examined whether and how the morphological structure of written words affects reading in word-based neglect dyslexia (neglexia), and what can be learned about morphological decomposition in reading from the effect of morphology on neglexia. The oral reading of 7 Hebrew-speaking participants with acquired neglexia at the word level – 6 with left neglexia and 1 with right neglexia - was evaluated. The main finding was that the morphological role of the letters on the neglected side of the word affected neglect errors: When an affix appeared on the neglected side, it was neglected significantly more often than when the neglected side was part of the root; root letters on the neglected side were never omitted, whereas affixes were. Perceptual effects of length and final letter form were found for words with an affix on the neglected side, but not for words in which a root letter appeared in the neglected side. Semantic and lexical factors did not affect the participants' reading and error pattern, and neglect errors did not preserve the morpho-lexical characteristics of the target words. These findings indicate that an early morphological decomposition of words to their root and affixes occurs before access to the lexicon and to semantics, at the orthographic-visual analysis stage, and that the effects did not result from lexical feedback. The same effects of morphological structure on reading were manifested by the participants with left- and right-sided neglexia. Since neglexia is a deficit at the orthographic-visual analysis level, the effect of morphology on reading patterns in neglexia further supports that morphological decomposition occurs in the orthographic-visual analysis stage, prelexically, and that the search for the three letters of the root in Hebrew is a trigger for attention shift in neglexia.},

Twenty-eight subjects were engaged in a lexical decision task.

With respect to the prime a word target could be either a correct completion, a violation of a semantic selection restriction, or a violation of a syntactic subcategorization rule. An N400-like wave was elicited by both types of deviations. Syntactic anomalies evoked a negative shift predominantly over the anterior scalp with a preponderance over the left hemisphere, while semantic anomalies were accompanied by a much more widespread negativity with the maximum over posterior temporal areas. The amplitude of the semantic vie lation effect was found to be related to the strength of the priming constraints. The topographic difference is consistent with the idea that syntactic and semantic aspects of comprehension are handled by different neural subsystems.},

He was unable to grasp a pen and write, to fasten his shirt buttons or to hold a cup in one hand. Part of his difficulty lay in the absence of any automatic reflex correction in his voluntary movements, and also to an inability to sustain constant levels of muscle contraction without visual feedback over periods of more than one or two seconds.

Third, inference with the model is Bayesian and provides a principled and efficient means of pooling information across disparate data from different individuals. Because the model efficiently pools information across individuals, it is particularly well suited for those common cases in which the researcher collects a limited number of observations from several participants. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the hierarchical Bayesian model provides more accurate estimates than several popular competitors do.

A conspicuous N170 was recorded for both face categories. Pictures of animal faces were associated with a N170 of similar amplitude compared to pictures of human faces, but with delayed peak latency. Picture inversion enhanced N170 amplitude for human faces and delayed its peak for both human and animal faces. Finally, whether processed as targets or non-targets, depending on the task, both human and animal face N170 were identical. Thus, human faces in natural scenes elicit a clear but non-specific N170 that is not modulated by task status. What appears to be specific to human faces is the strength of the inversion effect.},

Here we used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to investigate semantic, morphological and formal (orthographic) processing conjointly in a masked priming paradigm. We directly compared morphological to both semantic and formal/orthographic priming (shared letters) on verbs. Masked priming was used to reduce strategic effects related to prime perception and to suppress semantic priming effects. The three types of priming led to distinct ERP and behavioral patterns: semantic priming was not found, while formal and morphological priming resulted in diverging ERP patterns. These results are consistent with models of lexical processing that make reference to morphological structure. We discuss how they fit in with the existing literature and how unresolved issues could be addressed in further studies.

The research reported here investigated the influence of semantic transparency on long-term morphological priming. Two experiments demonstrated that while lexical decisions were facilitated by semantically transparent primes like TEACHER, semantically opaque words like CORNER had no effect. Although differences in the nonword foils used in each experiment gave rise to somewhat different patterns of results, this difference in the effects of transparent and opaque primes was found in both experiments.

  abstract = {Investigations of the impact of morphemic boundaries on transposed-letter (TL) priming effects have yielded conflicting results. Five masked priming lexical decision experiments were conducted to examine the interaction of letter transpositions and morphemic boundaries with English suffixed derivations. Experiments 1–3 found that responses to monomorphemic target words (e.g., SPEAK) were facilitated to the same extent by morphologically related primes containing letter transpositions that did (SPEAEKR) or did not (SPEKAER) cross a morphemic boundary. This pattern was also observed in Experiments 4 and 5, in which the targets (e.g., SPEAKER) were the base forms of the TL primes. Thus, in these experiments the influence of the morphological structure of a TL prime did not depend on whether the letter transposition crossed a morphological boundary.},

ERPs to the semantic primes were more negative-going than those to targets. This difference peaked around 400-450 msec after stimulus onset. Comparison of unrepeated and repeated words revealed a larger and temporally more extended difference, with a similar scalp topography. The prime-target differences are interpreted as a further example of the sensitivity of the N400 component of the ERP to semantic relationships between words.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 3 midline sites and from left and right inferior parietal sites. The peak latency of a late positive component, P637, covaried with RT, with variations in latency of around half the corresponding RT variations. The peak-to-peak amplitude of N100-P187 interacted with stimulus and task, such that it was larger for nonwords in the REAL task and words in the REAL/PSEUD task. The P637 latency data support a model of RT variation based on the interaction of changes in parallel response preparation and stimulus evaluation processes. The observations with respect to N100-P187 suggest that ERPs are sensitive to factors related to the early processing of words and wordlike visual material.

Some words were repetitions, either within- or across-modality, of words presented six items previously. Visual-visual repetition evoked a sustained positive shift, which onset around 250 msec and comprised two topographically and temporally distinct components. Auditory-visual repetition modulated only the later of these two components. For auditory EMS, within- and across-modality repetition evoked effects with similar onset latencies. The within-modality effect was initially the larger, but only at posterior sites. In Experiment 2, critical items were auditory and visual nonwords, and target items were auditory words and visual pseudohomophones. Visual-visual nonword repetition effects onset around 450 msec, and demonstrated a more anterior scalp distribution than those evoked by auditory-visual repetition. Visual-auditory repetition evoked only a small, late-onsetting effect, whereas auditory-auditory repetition evoked an effect that, at parietal sites only, was almost equivalent to that from the analogous condition of Experiment 1. These findings indicate that, as indexed by ERF's, repetition effects both within- and across-modality are influenced by lexical status.

One set of cues which learners might use to acquire phrase structure are the dependencies, or predictive relationships, which link elements within phrases. In order to determine whether learners can use this statistical information, adults and children were exposed to artificial languages that either contained or violated the kinds of dependencies that characterize natural languages. Additional experiments contrasted the acquisition of these linguistic systems with the same grammars implemented as non-linguistic input (sequences of nonlinguistic sounds or shapes). Predictive relationships yielded better learning for sequentially presented auditory stimuli, and for simultaneously presented visual stimuli, but no such advantage was found for sequentially presented visual stimuli. Learning outcomes were not affected by the degree to which the input contained linguistic content. These findings suggest that constraints on learning mechanisms that mirror the structure of natural languages are not tailored solely for language learning.

The learner might be further aided by language-specific prosodic cues correlated with word boundaries. As a first step in testing these hypotheses, we briefly exposed adults to an artificial language in which the only cues available for word segmentation were the transitional probabilities between syllables. Subjects were able to learn the words of this language. Furthermore, the addition of certain prosodic cues served to enhance performance.

We found that most dyslexic children showed a phonological deficit, either in terms of response accuracy (92.1\% of the sample), speed (84.8\%), or both (79.3\%). Deficits in visual attention span, as measured by partial report ability, affected 28.1\% of dyslexic participants, all of which also showed a phonological deficit. Visual stress, as measured by subjective reports of visual discomfort, affected 5.5\% of dyslexic participants, not more than controls (8.5\%). Although phonological variables explained a large amount of variance in literacy skills, visual variables did not explain any additional variance. Finally, children with comorbid phonological and visual deficits did not show more severe reading disability than children with a pure phonological deficit. These results (a) confirm the importance of phonological deficits in dyslexia; (b) suggest that visual attention span may play a role, but a minor one, at least in this population; (c) do not support any involvement of visual stress in dyslexia. Among the factors that may explain some differences with previously published studies, the present sample is characterized by very stringent inclusion criteria, in terms of the severity of reading disability and in terms of exclusion of comorbidities. This may exacerbate the role of phonological deficits to the detriment of other factors playing a role in reading acquisition. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

These results have led to the suggestion that a cross-linguistic difference may exist in the recognition of Spanish and English words. In two masked-priming experiments run on separate groups of Spanish and English speakers, we tested this hypothesis by comparing the impacts of primes with letter transpositions that arose within morphemes or across morpheme boundaries on the recognition of identical or near-identical Spanish–English cognate targets. The results showed transposed-letter benefits in both Spanish and English that were not modulated by the position of the transposed letter in the prime stimulus. Our findings therefore add to the growing body of literature suggesting that the transposed-letter benefit is not affected by the position of the transposed letters relative to the morpheme boundary, and they dispel previous suggestions that there might be a genuine difference in orthographic coding across the Spanish and English writing systems.},

Although participants were not told the nature of the learning task, they exhibited learning after their initial exposure to the stimuli. Independent component analysis of the brain data revealed five task-related sub-networks. Unlike prior statistical learning studies of word segmentation, this morphological learning task robustly activated the inferior frontal gyrus during the learning period. This region was represented in multiple independent components, suggesting it functions as a network hub for this type of learning. Moreover, the results suggest that subnetworks activated by statistical learning are driven by the nature of the input, rather than reflecting a general statistical learning system.},

  abstract = {The sensory input that we experience is highly patterned, and we are experts at detecting these regularities. Although the extraction of such regularities, or statistical learning (SL), is typically viewed as a cortical process, recent studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including the hippocampus. These studies have employed fMRI, leaving open the possibility that the MTL is involved but not necessary for SL. Here, we examined this issue in a case study of LSJ, a patient with complete bilateral hippocampal loss and broader MTL damage. In Experiments 1 and 2, LSJ and matched control participants were passively exposed to a continuous sequence of shapes, syllables, scenes, or tones containing temporal regularities in the co-occurrence of items. In a subsequent test phase, the control groups exhibited reliable SL in all conditions, successfully discriminating regularities from recombinations of the same items into novel foil sequences. LSJ, however, exhibited no SL, failing to discriminate regularities from foils. Experiment 3 ruled out more general explanations for this failure, such as inattention during exposure or difficulty following test instructions, by showing that LSJ could discriminate which individual items had been exposed. These findings provide converging support for the importance of the MTL in extracting temporal regularities.},

Here we propose that orthographic depth is a conglomerate of two separate constructs: the complexity of print-to-speech correspondences and the unpredictability of the derivation of the pronunciations of words on the basis of their orthography. We show that on a linguistic level, these two concepts can be dissociated. Furthermore, we make different predictions about how the two concepts would affect skilled reading and reading acquisition. We argue that refining the definition of orthographic depth opens up new research questions. Addressing these can provide insights into the specific mechanisms by which language-level orthographic properties affect cognitive processes underlying reading.},

Among potential correlates, previous research has studied group differences between dyslexic and control participants in performance on statistical learning tasks. A statistical learning deficit has been proposed to be a potential cause and/or a marker effect for early detection of dyslexia. It is therefore of practical importance to evaluate the evidence for a group difference. From a theoretical perspective, such a group difference would provide information about the causal chain from statistical learning to reading acquisition. We provide a systematic review of the literature on such a group difference. We conclude that there is insufficient high-quality data to draw conclusions about the presence or absence of an effect.},

Experiment 2 demonstrated ERP and behavioral priming in a lexical decision task for repetition and masked repetition priming. Topographical mapping of ERP repetition priming effects involved both early and late effects over the right and left anterior regions, whereas masked priming produced only an early ERP effect posteriorly.

For simplex, i.e., monomorphemic, nouns in Dutch, we studied the effect of the frequency of the monomorphemic noun itself as well as the effect of the frequencies of morphologically related forms on the processing of these monomorphemic nouns. The experiments show that the frequency of the (unseen) plural forms affects the experimental measures. Nouns with high-frequency plurals are responded to more quickly in visual lexical decision, and they receive higher subjective frequency ratings. However, the summed frequencies of the formations in the morphological family of a given noun (the compounds and derived words in which that noun appears as a constituent) did not affect the experimental measures. Surprisingly, the size of the morphological family, i.e., the number of different words in the family, emerged as a substantial factor. A monomorphemic noun with a large family size elicits higher subjective frequency ratings and shorter response latencies in visual lexical decision than a monomorphemic noun with a small family size. The effect of family size disappears in progressive demasking, a task which taps into the earlier stages of form identification. This suggests that the effect of family size arises at more central, post-identification stages of lexical processing.},

In semantics, distributional approaches posit that similarity between words can be derived from regularities of the contexts in which they appear.

Adapting methods from distributional semantics, we model the contextual similarity among alphanumeric characters in a large text corpus. We find modest correlations between model-derived similarities with similarity derived from a behavioral experiment. Beyond this result, model-derived similarity from neural embedding models captures key aspects of orthographic knowledge, like case, letter identity and consonant–vowel status. We conclude that the text environment contains regularities that are relevant to readers and that statistical learning is a promising way for this information to be acquired. More broadly, our results imply that statistical regularities are relevant not only at the level of word semantics but also individual written characters.},

Participants watched a classic inattentional blindness video (Simons \& Chabris, 1999) and were instructed to count passes among basketball players, wherein 58\% noticed the unexpected: a person wearing a gorilla suit. When participants were accurate with their pass counts, individuals with higher working memory capacity were more likely to report seeing the gorilla (67\%) than those with lesser working memory capacity (36\%).

Such words exhibit partial regularities concerning the correspondences between form and meaning, the treatment of which has important implications for linguistic and psycholinguistic theories.

Although I am invited to conferences such as the (lovely) one that inspired this volume on the basis of my computational modeling work, my real interest is in language—not models—and in reading as a particular realization of language. We usually emphasize the differences between language and reading: one evolved in the species, the other was invented (via writing); one is learned through immersion and exposure, the other through instruction and feedback; one is universal, the other is not; and so forth. Yet despite these differences, the same principles govern most aspects of both. For example, whatever the biological predispositions for spoken language turn out to be (e.g., whether they are specific to language, or language takes advantage of many enabling capacities), children still have to learn the language to which they are exposed. The procedures that underlie this learning are, apparently, the same as those that govern learning to read. Thus, the same computational architectures and learning procedures are being used to explain statistical learning in language acquisition and the child's later transition into reading (Saffran, 2009; Seidenberg, 2007). For such reasons, I see more similarities across reading and language than are usually acknowledged. One can study reading qua reading, which is interesting enough, but also because it sheds light on language more broadly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

  abstract = {Event-related potentials were used to study whether factors known to influence subject–verb number agreement in production exert analogous effects on sentence comprehension. Participants read Dutch sentences containing subject–verb number agreement errors while their brainwaves were measured. The determiner of the singular head noun could be ambiguous or unambiguous in number and the modifier (“local”) noun could be plural or singular. Both ambiguity and number match affect error rates in production. We expected evoked potentials in response to the verb to be modulated by number ambiguity; larger effects were expected when the sentences started with an unambiguous determiner. When the local noun was singular, we observed a more negative wave elicited by the incorrect verbs compared to the correct verbs in the 350–400~ms time-window. This effect was largest when the head noun phrase contained no number ambiguity. When the local noun was plural the waves were more positive for incorrect verbs than for correct verbs in the 600–650~ms time-window. Again this effect was largest when the head noun phrase contained no number ambiguity. Most importantly, the results show that agreement computation in comprehension is influenced by the same factors as in production. We further suggest that in the sentences with a singular local noun there is a shallow analysis of the sentence, but the sentences with a plural local noun require a deeper syntactic analysis.},

Recent advances in imaging technology, particularly the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging, provide evidence of a neurobiological signature for dyslexia, specifically a disruption of two left hemisphere posterior brain systems, one parieto-temporal, the other occipito-temporal, with compensatory engagement of anterior systems around the inferior frontal gyrus and a posterior (right occipito-temporal) system. Furthermore, good evidence indicates a computational role for the left occipito-temporal system: the development of fluent (automatic) reading. The brain systems for reading are malleable and their disruption in dyslexic children may be remediated by provision of an evidence-based, effective reading intervention. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of young adults with reading difficulties followed prospectively and longitudinally from age 5 through their mid twenties suggests that there may be two types of reading difficulties, one primarily on a genetic basis, the other, and far more common, reflecting environmental influences. These studies offer the promise for more precise identification and effective management of dyslexia in children, adolescents and adults.},

We first review the core concepts of dyslexia: its definition, prevalence, and developmental course. Next we examine the cognitive model of dyslexia, especially the phonological theory, and review empiric data suggesting genetic and neurobiological influences on the development of dyslexia. With the scientific underpinnings of dyslexia serving as a foundation, we turn our attention to evidence-based approaches to diagnosis and treatment, including interventions and accommodations. Teaching reading represents a major focus. We first review those reading interventions effective in early grades, and then review interventions for older students. To date the preponderance of intervention studies have focused on word-level reading; newer studies are beginning to examine reading interventions that have gone beyond word reading to affect reading fluency and reading comprehension.

  abstract = {Extraordinary progress in functional brain imaging, primarily advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging, now allows scientists to understand the neural systems serving reading and how these systems differ in dyslexic readers. Scientists now speak of the neural signature of dyslexia, a singular achievement that for the first time has made what was previously a hidden disability, now visible. Paralleling this achievement in understanding the neurobiology of dyslexia, progress in the identification and treatment of dyslexia now offers the hope of identifying children at risk for dyslexia at a very young age and providing evidence-based, effective interventions. Despite these advances, for many dyslexic readers, becoming a skilled, automatic reader remains elusive, in great part because though children with dyslexia can be taught to decode words, teaching children to read fluently and automatically represents the next frontier in research on dyslexia. We suggest that to break through this "fluency" barrier, investigators will need to reexamine the more than 20-year-old central dogma in reading research: the generation of the phonological code from print is modular, that is, automatic and not attention demanding, and not requiring any other cognitive process. Recent findings now present a competing view: other cognitive processes are involved in reading, particularly attentional mechanisms, and that disruption of these attentional mechanisms play a causal role in reading difficulties. Recognition of the role of attentional mechanisms in reading now offer potentially new strategies for interventions in dyslexia. In particular, the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents affecting attentional mechanisms not only may provide a window into the neurochemical mechanisms underlying dyslexia but also may offer a potential adjunct treatment for teaching dyslexic readers to read fluently and automatically. Preliminary studies suggest that agents traditionally used to treat disorders of attention, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, may prove to be an effective adjunct to improving reading in dyslexic students.

Indeed, previous studies have tied statistical learning (SL) abilities to reading skills, establishing the existence of a link between the two. However, some issues are currently left unanswered, including questions regarding the underlying bases for these associations as well as the types of statistical regularities actually assimilated by developing readers. Here we present an alternative approach to study the role of SL in literacy development, focusing on individual differences among beginning readers. Instead of using an artificial task to estimate SL abilities, our approach identifies individual differences in children's reliance on statistical regularities as reflected by actual reading behavior. We specifically focus on individuals' reliance on regularities in the mapping between print and speech versus associations between print and meaning in a word naming task. We present data from 399 children, showing that those whose oral naming performance is impacted more by print-speech regularities and less by associations between print and meaning have better reading skills. These findings suggest that a key route by which SL mechanisms impact developing reading abilities is via their role in the assimilation of sub-lexical regularities between printed and spoken language - and more generally, in detecting regularities that are more reliable than others. We discuss the implications of our findings to both SL and reading theories.},

Recent findings, however, show clear differences in processing regularities across modalities and stimuli as well as low correlations between performance on visual and auditory tasks. Why does a presumably domain-general mechanism show distinct patterns of modality and stimulus specificity? Here we claim that the key to this puzzle lies in the prior knowledge brought upon by learners to the learning task. Specifically, we argue that learners' already entrenched expectations about speech co-occurrences from their native language impacts what they learn from novel auditory verbal input. In contrast, learners are free of such entrenchment when processing sequences of visual material such as abstract shapes. We present evidence from three experiments supporting this hypothesis by showing that auditory-verbal tasks display distinct item-specific effects resulting in low correlations between test items. In contrast, non-verbal tasks - visual and auditory - show high correlations between items. Importantly, we also show that individual performance in visual and auditory SL tasks that do not implicate prior knowledge regarding co-occurrence of elements, is highly correlated. In a fourth experiment, we present further support for the entrenchment hypothesis by showing that the variance in performance between different stimuli in auditory-verbal statistical learning tasks can be traced back to their resemblance to participants' native language. We discuss the methodological and theoretical implications of these findings, focusing on models of domain generality/specificity of SL.},

In recent years, however, researchers show increased interest in individual abilities in SL, either to predict other cognitive capacities or as a tool for understanding the mechanism underlying SL. Most, if not all of this research enterprise employs SL tasks that were originally designed for group-level studies. We argue that from an individual difference perspective, such tasks are psychometrically weak and sometimes even flawed. In particular, existing SL tasks have three major shortcomings: (1) the number of trials in the test phase is often too small (or, there is extensive repetitions of the same targets throughout the test), (2) a large proportion of the sample performs at chance level so that most of the data points reflect noise, and (3) test items following familiarization are all of the same type and identical level of difficulty. These factors lead to high measurement error, inevitably resulting in low reliability and thereby doubtful validity. Here we present a novel method specifically designed for the measurement of individual differences in visual SL. The novel task we offer displays substantially superior psychometric properties. We report data regarding the reliability of the task, and discuss the importance of the implementation of such tasks in future research.},

However, to be able to reliably link individual differences in a given ability such as language learning to individual differences in SL, three critical theoretical questions should be posed: Is SL a componential or unified ability? Is it nested within other general cognitive abilities? Is it a stable capacity of an individual? Following an initial mapping sentence outlining the possible dimensions of SL, we employed a battery of SL tasks in the visual and auditory modalities, using verbal and non-verbal stimuli, with adjacent and non-adjacent contingencies. SL tasks were administered along with general cognitive tasks in a within-subject design at two time points to explore our theoretical questions. We found that SL, as measured by some tasks, is a stable and reliable capacity of an individual. Moreover, we found SL to be independent of general cognitive abilities such as intelligence or working memory. However, SL is not a unified capacity, so that individual sensitivity to conditional probabilities is not uniform across modalities and stimuli.},

  abstract = {In recent years, statistical learning (SL) research has seen a growing interest in tracking individual performance in SL tasks, mainly as a predictor of linguistic abilities. We review studies from this line of research and outline three presuppositions underlying the experimental approach they employ: (i) that SL is a unified theoretical construct; (ii) that current SL tasks are interchangeable, and equally valid for assessing SL ability; and (iii) that performance in the standard forced-choice test in the task is a good proxy of SL ability. We argue that these three critical presuppositions are subject to a number of theoretical and empirical issues. First, SL shows patterns of modality- and informational-specificity, suggesting that SL cannot be treated as a unified construct. Second, different SL tasks may tap into separate sub-components of SL that are not necessarily interchangeable. Third, the commonly used forced-choice tests in most SL tasks are subject to inherent limitations and confounds. As a first step, we offer a methodological approach that explicitly spells out a potential set of different SL dimensions, allowing for better transparency in choosing a specific SL task as a predictor of a given linguistic outcome. We then offer possible methodological solutions for better tracking and measuring SL ability. Taken together, these discussions provide a novel theoretical and methodological approach for assessing individual differences in SL, with clear testable predictions.

This suggests that variance in statistical learning (SL) performance reflects efficiency in encoding representations as well as efficiency in detecting their statistical properties. These processes have been taken to be independent and temporally modular, where first, elements in the stream are encoded into internal representations, and then the co-occurrences between them are computed and registered. Here, we entertain a novel hypothesis that one unifying construct—the rate of information in the sensory input—explains learning performance. This theoretical approach merges processes related to encoding of events and those related to learning their regularities into a single computational principle. We present data from two large-scale experiments with over 800 participants tested in support for this hypothesis, showing that rate of information in a visual stream clearly predicts SL performance, and that similar rate of information values leads to similar SL performance. We discuss the implications for SL theory and its relation to regularity learning.},

Responses of these brain regions are shaped by visual statistical learning. If such learning is compromised, people should be less sensitive to statistically likely feature combinations in words and other objects, and impaired visual word and object recognition should be expected. We therefore tested whether people with dyslexia showed diminished capability for visual statistical learning. Matched dyslexic and typical readers participated in tests of visual statistical learning of pairs of novel shapes that frequently appeared together. Dyslexic readers on average recognized fewer pairs than typical readers, indicating some problems with visual statistical learning. These group differences were not accounted for by differences in intelligence, ability to remember individual shapes, or spatial attention paid to the stimuli, but other attentional problems could play a mediating role. Deficiencies in visual statistical learning may in some cases prevent appropriate experience-driven shaping of neuronal responses in the ventral visual stream, hampering visual word and object recognition.},

  abstract = {The English orthography represents both phonemes and morphemes, implying that sensitivity to each of these units could play a role in the acquisition of decoding skills. This study offers some new evidence about sensitivity to morphemes and the decoding skills of American children in grades three to six. It focuses on knowledge of derivational suffixes, which is examined with sentence completion and sentence acceptability tasks that manipulate the suffixes in real words (e.g., electric, electricity) and nonsense derived forms (e.g., froodly, froodness). Both written and spoken materials are considered over the course of two experiments in which the children also received various reading tests, as well as tests of phonological awareness, vocabulary and intelligence. The results indicate that knowledge of derivational suffixes increases with grade level, along with decoding ability and phoneme awareness. Path analyses further reveal that, although there is a consistent correlation between performance on the derivational suffix materials and phoneme awareness and decoding ability, performance on the derivational suffix materials makes an independent and increasing contribution to decoding ability throughout the higher elementary grades.},

Schizophrenic (mean age 37.7 yrs) and healthy (mean age 25.5 yrs) participants read sentences in which the first clause ended with a homograph, and the second clause started with a target word that was semantically related to the homograph's dominant meaning (e.g., 1. Diving was forbidden from the bridge because the river had rocks in it. or 2. The guests played bridge because the river had rocks in it.). Processing of the targets (e.g., "river") was expected to be primarily influenced by the preceding overall sentence context (congruent in 1; incongruent in 2) in healthy participants, but to be inappropriately affected by the dominant meaning of homographs (e.g., the "structure" meaning of "bridge") in sentences like 2 in schizophrenic patients. The N400 ERP component that is known to be sensitive to contextual effects during language processing confirmed these predictions. This showed that language abnormalities in schizophrenia may be related to deficient processing of context- irrelevant semantic representations of words from the discourse.

The onset of this potential occurred shortly after object presentation, indicating that semantic integration is a rapid online component of real-world perception. In addition, the anomalies in movies evoked a large late positive potential at posterior regions, suggesting that in event perception, semantic incongruity may trigger cognitive processes other than those mediating pure semantic integration.

However, experiments that attempted to trace the development of automatic word recognition processes generated empirical paradoxes because the different criteria employed to operationalize the automaticity concept did not display convergent validity. For example, the development of obligatory processing did not completely coincide with the development of capacity-free processing. Recently, developmental reading theories have deemphasized the capacity component of the automaticity concept and have focused on another property: information encapsulation. The latter property is the centerpiece of the concept of modularity in cognitive science, a theoretical notion only partially overlapping with automaticity. Most current conceptions of the development of reading skill emphasize issues of the quality of lexical representations and information encapsulation—conceptions thought to be more empirically tractable than resource notions, given the history of methodological and theoretical complications involving the latter.},

  abstract = {Phonological processing skills have been shown to account for some, but not all, of the variance in the word recognition ability of both children and adults. In two studies with adult subjects in the United States, the authors investigated whether orthographic processing ability--the ability to form, store, and access orthographic representations--can account for some of the additional variance in word recognition and spelling skill. A new measure of individual differences in exposure to print--the Author Recognition Test--was developed and validated in the two studies. This measure was designed to be relatively free of a confound that has plagued most print exposure indicators used in studies of adults: the tendency of respondents to give socially desirable answers. The Author Recognition Test was shown to be a remarkably robust and independent predictor of word processing ability. In Study 2, subjects' performance on this measure was shown to predict variance in orthographic processing independent of phonological factors. The results of the two studies were supportive of the idea that there are individual differences in reading and spelling caused by variation in orthographic processing skills. Moreover, these orthographic processing skills appear to be linked to print exposure, and thus to be environmentally mediated, rather than being simply indirect products of differences in phonological processing ability. Both studies demonstrate the potential usefulness of the Author Recognition Test as an indicator of print exposure in research on the cognitive consequences of literacy. /// [French] Les recherches antérieures ont montré que certaines habiletés de traitement phonologique comptent pour une partie de la variance dans la reconnaissance de mots aussi bien par les adultes que par les enfants. Deux expériences ont été menées auprès d'adultes américains pour voir dans quelle mesure le traitement orthographique peut compter pour une partie de variance supplémentaire dans la reconnaissance de mots et l'épellation. Une nouvelle mesure du degré d'exposition à l'écrit a été développée et validée dans les deux expériences: Le test de reconnaissance d'auteurs (ART). Cette mesure a été développée pour contourner le problème posé par les méthodes habituellement utilisées dans les recherches auprès d'adultes, qui font qu'ils ont tendance à répondre en conformité avec ce qu'ils jugent socialement acceptable. Le test de reconnaissance d'auteurs s'est révélé un prédicteur extrêmement robuste et indépendant de l'habileté à traiter des mots. Dans la seconde expérience, les résultats des sujets à cette mesure ont permis de prédire une partie importante de la variance pour le traitement orthographique indépendamment des facteurs phonologiques. Les résultats aux deux expériences appuient l'idée qu'une partie des différences individuelles en lecture et en épellation est due aux habiletés de traitement orthographique. De plus, ces habiletés de traitement orthographique apparaissent liées au degré d'exposition à l'écrit ce qui permet de poser comme hypothèse que l'acquisition de ces habiletés est conditionnée par l'environnement et n'est pas uniquement le produit des différences individuelles dans les habiletés de traitement phonologique. Les deux expériences ont confirmé l'utilité du test de reconnaissance d'auteurs comme mesure du degré d'exposition à l'écrit dans les recherches sur les conséquences cognitives de la littéracie. /// [Spanish] Las habilidades de procesamiento fonológico han explicado algunas, pero no todas, las variaciones en la habilidad para reconocer palabras tanto en niños como en adultos. En dos experimentos con sujetos adultos en los Estados Unidos, los autores investigaron si la habilidad de procesamiento ortográfico puede explicar la varianza adicional en el reconocimiento de palabras y su habilidad ortográfica. Una nueva medida de diferencias individuales en la exposición a materiales impresos--La prueba de reconocimiento de autores (ART)--fue desarrollada y validada en dos experimentos. Esta medida fue diseñada para estar relativamente libre de un problema que han sufrido la mayoría de los indicadores de exposición a materiales impresos que se usan en estudios de adultos--la tendencia de los sujetos a dar respuestas que ellos piensan son las que se esperan de ellos; las socialmente deseables. La prueba de reconocimiento de autores demostró ser un predictor notablemente robusto e independiente para predecir la habilidad de procesar palabras. En el Experimento 2, el desempeño de los sujetos en esta medida demostró que podía predecir la variabilidad en el procesamiento ortográfico, de manera independiente de los factores fonológicos. Los resultados de dos experimentos apoyan la idea de que hay diferencias individuales en lectura y ortografía causadas por la variación en las habilidades del procesamiento ortográfico. Además, estas habilidades de procesamiento ortográfico parecen estar relacionadas con la exposición a materiales impresos, y de esta manera estar mediados ambientalmente más bien, que ser simplemente productos indirectos de diferencias en la habilidad del procesamiento fonológico. Ambos estudios demostraron la ayuda potencial que la prueba de reconocimiento de autores tiene como un indicador de exposición a materiales impresos en la investigación de las consecuencias cognitivas del alfabetismo. /// [German] In der Vergangenheit war gezeigt worden, daß die Fähigkeiten der phonologischen Verarbeitung nur für einen Teil des Unterschieds in der Fähigkeit des Worterkennens zwischen Kindern und Erwachsenen zuständig waren. In zwei Experimenten, die mit Erwachsenen in den Vereinigten Staaten durchgeführt wurden, untersuchten die Verfasser, ob die Fähigkeit der orthographischen Verarbeitung für einen Teil des weiteren Unterschieds im Worterkennen und in der Rechtschreibkenntnis verantwortlich zeichnen kann. Für das Messen individueller Unterschiede bei der Wahrnehmung gedruckter Texte wurde ein neuer Maßstab aufgestellt und in zwei Experimenten bestätigt: der Test über Erkennen des Verfassers (ART). Dieser Maßstab wurde so aufgestellt, daß er relativ frei von einem Durcheinander ist, das die meisten Studien mit Erwachsenen, in denen Anzeigen über das Wahrnehmen gedruckter Texte untersucht wurden, negativ beeinflußte: die Neigung seitens der Teilnehmer, Antworten zu geben, die sie gesellschaftlich für erwünscht heilten. Es stellte sich heraus, daß der Verfassererkennungstest eine bemerkenswert beständige und unabhängige Voraussage der Wortverarbeitungsfähigkeiten leistete. Im zweiten Experiment zeigte sich, daß die Leistungen der Teilnehmer bei diesem Maßstab Unterschiede in der orthographischen Verarbeitung, die von phonologischen Faktoren unabhängig war, voraussagte. Die Resultate beider Experimente unterstützen die Vorstellung, daß beim Lesen und Buchstabieren individuelle Unterschiede bestehen, die durch Verschiedenheiten in den Fertigkeiten der orthographischen Verarbeitung hervorgerufen werden. Zusätzlich scheinen diese Fertigkeiten in der orthographischen Verarbeitung mit einer Wahrnehmung gedruckter Texte in Verbindung zu stehen und deshalb durch die Umgebung vermittelt zu sein--und nicht etwa einfach nur Nebenprodukte der Unterschiede in der Fertigkeit der phonologischen Verarbeitung zu sein. Beide Studien bewiesen die potentielle Nützlichkeit des Verfassererkennungstests als Textwahrnehmungsmaßstab in der Forschung über kognitive Auswirkungen in der Beherrschung der Schriftsprache.}

Forty German-speaking adults completed a speech repetition task in which they repeated eight-syllable sequences from two experimental languages: one containing disyllabic words comprised of frequently occurring German syllable transitions (naturalistic words) and the other containing words made from unattested syllable transitions (non-naturalistic words). The participants demonstrated learning from both naturalistic and non-naturalistic stimuli. However, learning was superior for the naturalistic sequences, indicating that the participants had used their existing distributional knowledge of German to extract the naturalistic words faster and more accurately than the non-naturalistic words. This finding supports theories of statistical learning as a form of chunking, whereby frequently co-occurring units become entrenched in long-term memory.},

  abstract = {Within the framework of Friederici’s (2002) neurocognitive model of sentence processing, the early left anterior negativity (ELAN) in event-related potentials (ERPs) has been claimed to be a brain marker of syntactic first-pass parsing. As ELAN components seem to be exclusively elicited by word category violations (phrase structure violations), they have been taken as strong empirical support for syntax-first models of sentence processing and have gained considerable impact on psycholinguistic theory in a variety of domains. The present article reviews relevant ELAN studies and raises a number of serious issues concerning the reliability and validity of the findings. We also discuss how baseline problems and contextual factors can contribute to early ERP effects in studies examining word category violations. We conclude that – despite the apparent wealth of ELAN data – the functional significance of these findings remains largely unclear. The present paper does not claim to have falsified the existence of ELANs or syntax-related early frontal negativities. However, by separating facts from myths, the paper attempts to make a constructive contribution to how future ERP research in the area of syntax processing may better advance our understanding of online sentence comprehension.},

Participants were presented with target words either bearing dominant (on the penultimate syllable; 'graNIta,' 'seNIle,' slush, senile) or non-dominant stress (on the antepenultimate syllable; 'MISsile,' 'BIbita,' missile, drink), and either having a consistent (graNIta, MISsile) or an inconsistent stress neighborhood (seNIle, BIbita). Our results showed in the initial stages of processing an effect that we interpreted as an early orthographic marker of stress neighborhood in interaction with dominance. Later, from 250 ms after target onset, a marker of the lexical stress difference also emerged. The role of stress assignment in word recognition is discussed.},

Although grand-mean analysis showed a biphasic LAN-P600 pattern to grammatical violations, analysis of individuals׳ ERP responses showed that brain responses varied systematically along a continuum between negativity- and positivity-dominant ERP responses across individuals. Moreover, the left hemisphere topography of the negativity resulted from component overlap between a centro-parietal N400 in some individuals and a right hemisphere-dominant P600 in others. Our results show that biphasic ERP waveforms do not always reflect separable processing stages within individuals, and moreover, that the LAN can be a variant of the N400. These results show that there are multiple neurocognitive routes to successful grammatical comprehension in language users across the proficiency spectrum. Our results underscore that understanding and quantifying individual differences can provide an important source of evidence about language processing in the general population.},

  abstract = {Although it is widely known that high-pass filters can reduce the amplitude of slow ERP components, these filters can also introduce artifactual peaks that lead to incorrect conclusions. To demonstrate this and provide evidence about optimal filter settings, we recorded ERPs in a typical language processing paradigm involving syntactic and semantic violations. Unfiltered results showed standard N400 and P600 effects in the semantic and syntactic violation conditions, respectively. However, high-pass filters with cutoffs at 0.3 Hz and above produced artifactual effects of opposite polarity before the true effect. That is, excessive high-pass filtering introduced a significant N400 effect preceding the P600 in the syntactic condition, and a significant P2 effect preceding the N400 in the semantic condition. Thus, inappropriate use of high-pass filters can lead to false conclusions about which components are influenced by a given manipulation. The present results also lead to practical recommendations for high-pass filter settings that maximize statistical power while minimizing filtering artifacts.},

The present research examined spatial description processing using an electrophysiological measure, event-related potentials (ERPs), using 20 college students for each experiment. ERP's fine-grained temporal resolution allows examination of cognitive processes as they unfold. A second behavioral study provides comparison results. This initial study indicates that spatial description comprehension relates to semantic integration. Given this interpretation, data also suggest multiple frame activation with then primary selection of the intrinsic reference frame.

This study interrogated the neural representations in ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT) that support this transformation process. Twenty-four adults learned to read 2 sets of 24 novel words that shared phonemes and semantic categories but were written in different artificial orthographies. Following 2 wk of training, participants read the trained words while neural activity was measured with functional MRI. Representational similarity analysis on item pairs from the same orthography revealed that right vOT and posterior regions of left vOT were sensitive to basic visual similarity. Left vOT encoded letter identity and representations became more invariant to position along a posterior-to-anterior hierarchy. Item pairs that shared sounds or meanings, but were written in different orthographies with no letters in common, evoked similar neural patterns in anterior left vOT. These results reveal a hierarchical, posterior-to-anterior gradient in vOT, in which representations of letters become increasingly invariant to position and are transformed to convey spoken language information.},

This can be shown by studying behavioral and neurophysiological measures of accelerated word recognition when semantically or phonemically related information is provided in advance, resulting in accompanying attenuation of the respective event-related potential, i.e. the N400 effect. Against the background of age-dependent changes in a broad variety of lexical capacities, we aimed to study whether word priming is accomplished differently in elderly compared to young persons. 19 young (29.9\,±\,5.6~years) and 15 older (69.0\,±\,7.2~years) healthy adults participated in a primed lexical decision task that required the classification of target stimuli (words or pseudo-words) following related or unrelated prime words. We assessed reaction time, task accuracy and N400 responses. Acceleration of word recognition by semantic and phonemic priming was significant in both groups, but resulted in overall larger priming effects in the older participants. Compared with young adults, the older participants were slower and less accurate in responding to unrelated word-pairs. The expected N400 effect was smaller in older than young adults, particularly during phonemic word and pseudo-word priming, with a rather similar N400 amplitude reduction by semantic relatedness. The observed~pattern of~results is consistent with preserved or even enhanced lexical context sensitivity in older compared to young adults. This, however, appears to involve compensatory cognitive strategies with higher lexical processing costs during phonological processing in particular, suggested by a reduced N400 effect in the elderly.},

Visual ERPs were recorded, while Chinese adults performed an orthographic statistical learning task involving artificial characters varying in high, moderate, and low levels of positional consistency. The negative ERP deflection at the N1 time window, typically linked with orthographic regularity processing, was found in orthographic statistical learning with the low and moderate consistencies eliciting larger neural responses than the high consistency in the time window of 150–210 ms over occipital–temporal brain areas. These results suggest that orthographic statistical learning begins within the first 210 ms and that the N1 might be its neural indicator.},

Some studies have revealed that individual differences in the capacity for implicit statistical learning are linked with children's reading skills in English, which has a deep orthography, but we do not know whether the same relation is found in semi-transparent orthographies such as Norwegian. Additionally, the relative contribution of statistical learning alongside other cognitive measures known to be related to reading has not been examined. This study of sixty-five Norwegian school children (M\,=\,10.3\,years) found that performance on an independent statistical learning task predicted a small, but unique amount of variance in reading ability in Norwegian, even when a number of other reading-related cognitive skills were taken into account. This suggests that children's implicit learning of statistical regularities is associated with proficiency with written language in a semi-transparent orthography such as Norwegian.},

Method The tutorial begins with a discussion of statistical learning and its characteristics. It then discusses research on how statistical learning plays out in learning to spell, how spelling should be taught, and similarities and differences among learners. The focus is on the learning of English, although studies of other alphabetic writing systems are also considered. Research shows that, from an early age, children use their statistical learning skills to learn about the visual characteristics of written words. Children also use their statistical learning skills to help learn about the relations between visual units and units of language, supplementing what they are explicitly taught in school. Conclusion Statistical learning plays an important role in learning to spell, and this can help to explain why some aspects of spelling are more difficult to learn than others. If children are to learn to spell effectively and efficiently, structured instruction is also important.},

This unsupervised learning occurs without intent or awareness, but little is known about how it relates to other types of learning, how it affects perceptual processing, and how quickly it can occur. Here we use fMRI during statistical learning to explore these questions. Participants viewed statistically structured versus unstructured sequences of shapes while performing a task unrelated to the structure. Robust neural responses to statistical structure were observed, and these responses were notable in four ways: First, responses to structure were observed in the striatum and medial temporal lobe, suggesting that statistical learning may be related to other forms of associative learning and relational memory. Second, statistical regularities yielded greater activation in category-specific visual regions (object-selective lateral occipital cortex and word-selective ventral occipito-temporal cortex), demonstrating that these regions are sensitive to information distributed in time. Third, evidence of learning emerged early during familiarization, showing that statistical learning can operate very quickly and with little exposure. Finally, neural signatures of learning were dissociable from subsequent explicit familiarity, suggesting that learning can occur in the absence of awareness. Overall, our findings help elucidate the underlying nature of statistical learning.},

Differences in lexical structure, in the form of the regular and irregular past tense, have proven to be critical in this debate by contrasting a highly predictable rule-like process (e.g., jump-jumped) with an unpredictable idiosyncratic process typified by the irregulars (e.g., think-thought). The key issue raised by these contrasts is whether processing regular and irregular past tense forms differentially engages different aspects of the neural language system or whether they are processed within a single system that distinguishes between them purely on the basis of phonological and semantic differences. The correlational analyses provide clear evidence for a functional differentiation between different brain regions associated with the processing of lexical form, meaning, and morphological structure.},

The contrast between regular and irregular English verb inflection has been pivotal to this debate. Behavioural dissociations related to different lesion sites in brain-damaged patients suggest that processing regular and irregular past tenses involves different neural systems. Using event-related fMRI in a group of unimpaired young adults, we contrast processing of spoken regular and irregular past tense forms in a same–different judgement task, shown in earlier research with patients to engage left hemisphere language systems. An extensive fronto-temporal network, linking anterior cingulate (ACC), left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC) and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), was preferentially activated for regularly inflected forms. Access to meaning from speech is supported by temporal cortex, but additional processing is required for forms that end in regular inflections, which differentially engage LIFC processes that support morpho-phonological segmentation and grammatical analysis.},

The declarative/procedural (DP) model claims that the mental lexicon of memorized word-specific knowledge depends on the largely temporal-lobe substrates of declarative memory, which underlies the storage and use of knowledge of facts and events. The mental grammar, which subserves the rule-governed combination of lexical items into complex representations, depends on a distinct neural system. The functions of the two brain systems, together with their anatomical, physiological and biochemical substrates, lead to specific claims and predictions regarding their roles in language. Empirical evidence is presented from neuroimaging studies of normal language processing, and from developmental and adult-onset disorders. It is argued that this evidence supports the DP model. It is additionally proposed that "language" disorders, such as specific language impairment and non-fluent and fluent aphasia, may be profitably viewed as impairments primarily affecting one or the other brain system. Overall, the data suggest a new neurocognitive framework for the study of lexicon and grammar. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).},

Associations between letters and speech sounds form the basis of reading in alphabetic scripts. We investigated the functional neuroanatomy of the integration of letters and speech sounds using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Letters and speech sounds were presented unimodally and bimodally in congruent or incongruent combinations. Analysis of single-subject data and group data aligned on the basis of individual cortical anatomy revealed that letters and speech sounds are integrated in heteromodal superior temporal cortex. Interestingly, responses to speech sounds in a modality-specific region of the early auditory cortex were modified by simultaneously presented letters. These results suggest that efficient processing of culturally defined associations between letters and speech sounds relies on neural mechanisms similar to those naturally evolved for integrating audiovisual speech.},

With a series of visual lexical decision experiments in both languages, the authors find that the opposite is the case for derivational morphology: for English, parsing of morphological constituents is often required, whereas for Finnish, full-form storage and access seems to be the rule.

In related neuropsychological work, Ullman et al. (1997) proposed a dual-route model for past tense processing, in which the lexicon (used for access to irregularly inflected forms) corresponds to declarative memory and a medial temporal/ parietal circuit, and the rule system (used for computation of regularly inflected forms) corresponds to procedural memory and a frontal (including Broca's area)/basal ganglia circuit. We used functional MRI and a memory encoding task to test this model for derivationally suffixed words, comparing those words that show evidence of decompositional processing in behavioral studies (-ness, -less, and -able words) with derived words that do not show decomposition effects (-ity and -ation words). By examining Broca's area and the basal ganglia as regions of interest, we found that "decomposable" derived and inflected words showed increases in activity relative to nondecomposable suffixed words. Results support a dual-route model of lexical access of complex words that is consistent with the Ullman et al. proposal.},

  abstract = {Visual statistical learning (VSL) was traditionally tested through offline two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) questions. More recently, online reaction time (RT) measures and alternative offline question types have been developed to further investigate learning during exposure and more adequately assess individual differences in adults (Siegelman et al., 2017b, 2018). We assessed the usefulness of these measures for investigating VSL in early-school-aged children. Secondarily, we examined the effect of introducing a cover task, potentially affecting attention, on children’s VSL performance. Fifty-three children (aged 5–8 years) performed a self-paced VSL task containing triplets, in which participants determine the presentation speed and RTs to each stimulus are recorded. Half of the participants performed a cover task, while the other half did not. Online sensitivity to the statistical structure was measured by contrasting RTs to unpredictable versus predictable elements. Subsequently, participants completed 2-AFC (choose correct triplet) and 3-AFC (fill blank to complete triplet) offline questions. RTs were significantly longer for unpredictable than predictable elements, so we conclude that early-school-aged children are sensitive to the statistical structure during exposure, and that the RT task can measure that. We found no evidence as to whether children can perform above chance on offline 2-AFC or 3-AFC questions, or whether the cover task affects children’s VSL performance. These results show the feasibility of using an online RT task when assessing VSL in early-school-aged children. This task therefore seems suitable for future studies that aim to investigate VSL across development or in clinical populations, perhaps together with behavioral tasks.},

Research in this area of inquiry has pursued causal explanations at the biological, cognitive, behavioral, and environmental levels of analysis (Vellutino, Fletcher, Snowling, \& Scanlon, 2004). Our primary concern in this chapter is to distinguish between manifest causes of early reading difficulties and underlying causes of such difficulties. We define manifest causes in terms of observed deficiencies in the knowledge and component skills the child must acquire in order to become a proficient reader and underlying causes in terms of biologically based cognitive deficits or environmental deficits that might impair the acquisition of those skills. Thus, we first define dyslexia and provide documentation of its primary behavioral manifestations. We proceed to discuss theories of dyslexia, specifying cognitive deficits presumed to underlie this disorder, and then go on to address the question of whether there are subtypes of dyslexia. We close with a brief discussion of research documenting the importance of distinguishing between reading problems caused primarily by biologically based cognitive deficits and reading problems caused primarily by experiential and instructional deficits.

  abstract = {We summarize some of the most important findings from research evaluating the hypothesized causes of specific reading disability (‘dyslexia’) over the past four decades. After outlining components of reading ability, we discuss manifest causes of reading difficulties, in terms of deficiencies in component reading skills that might lead to such difficulties. The evidence suggests that inadequate facility in word identification due, in most cases, to more basic deficits in alphabetic coding is the basic cause of difficulties in learning to read. We next discuss hypothesized deficiencies in reading-related cognitive abilities as underlying causes of deficiencies in component reading skills. The evidence in these areas suggests that, in most cases, phonological skills deficiencies associated with phonological coding deficits are the probable causes of the disorder rather than visual, semantic, or syntactic deficits, although reading difficulties in some children may be associated with general language deficits. Hypothesized deficits in general learning abilities (e.g., attention, association learning, cross-modal transfer etc.) and low-level sensory deficits have weak validity as causal factors in specific reading disability. These inferences are, by and large, supported by research evaluating the biological foundations of dyslexia. Finally, evidence is presented in support of the idea that many poor readers are impaired because of inadequate instruction or other experiential factors. This does not mean that biological factors are not relevant, because the brain and environment interact to produce the neural networks that support reading acquisition. We conclude with a discussion of the clinical implications of the research findings, focusing on the need for enhanced instruction.},

The prevailing inhibition hypothesis takes larger reaction-time (RT) costs for switching to the first language (L1) than to the second language (L2) as evidence for suppression of the non-target language. Switch cost asymmetries can alternatively be explained by an L1-repeat-benefit, assuming selective absence of language competition in repeating L1. To test the latter hypothesis, RTs and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded when unbalanced Dutch–English bilinguals switched between overt picture naming in L1 and L2. Preparation time (short versus long cue–stimulus intervals) modulated the degree to which top-down inhibitory control biased language competition, as indexed by the N2 component of the ERP. RT switch costs were asymmetrical on short intervals and symmetrical on long intervals. Preparation interval effects were observed in all conditions except for L1 repeat trials. This pattern was present both for RT and N2 data, thereby supporting the L1-repeat-benefit hypothesis. These results suggest that inhibition is not necessary, but can modulate the efficiency of language switching.},

  abstract = {The stimulus evaluation view on P3 latency holds that P3 latency mainly reflects stimulus-processing time, in contrast to response-processing lime. A review of the experimental evidence, however, leads to the conclusion that P3 is not a sensitive tool for separating between stimulus and response-related processes. Rather, it appears that P3 latency is a sensitive index of any response-time changes when response times in the fast condition are brief, with its sensitivity decreasing when response times in the fast condition get longer. This regularity was confirmed by a detailed analysis of the published evidence from Steinberg's task and was not attributable to speed-accuracy trade-off or to different methods of parameterization. The structures generating the scalp P3b are involved both in stimulus processing and in response selection. Response selection may exert its effect on P3 in one of two ways: either directly, fully delaying P3 latency, or affecting a second P3 component (P-CR) only, thus having an attenuated effect on P3 latency.},

The available WM capacity was varied by three orthogonal manipulations: (1) syntactic complexity; (2) additional WM load; and (3) verbal WM span. The processing of the morphosyntactic violations was reflected in longer RTs in ungrammatical compared with grammatical sentences, and in an anterior negativity and a centroparietal positivity in the ERPs. While the behavioral grammaticality effect was not influenced by the WM manipulations, the ERP effects were. The amplitude of the anterior negativity was modulated by the combination of complexity and load, and by WM span. The onset of the centroparietal positivity was delayed in the high-load condition, and for the low-span group. ERPs over the course of the sentences showed a frontal negative slow wave under high WM load, largest for the low-span group. The finding that online syntactic processing is related to WM span and to additional WM load does not support the theory that there is a WM capacity specific for syntactic processing.

  abstract = {The set of design features developed by Charles Hockett in the 1950s and 1960s remains probably the most influential means of juxtaposing animal communication with human language. However, the general theoretical perspective of Hockett is largely incompatible with that of modern language evolution research. Consequently, we argue that his classificatory system—while useful for some descriptive purposes—is of very limited use as a theoretical framework for evolutionary linguistics. We see this incompatibility as related to the ontology of language, i.e. deriving from Hockett’s interest in language as a product rather than a suite of sensorimotor, cognitive and social abilities that enable the use but also acquisition of language by biological creatures (the faculty of language). After a reconstruction of Hockett’s views on design features, we raise two criticisms: focus on the means at the expense of content and focus on the code itself rather than the cognitive abilities of its users. Finally, referring to empirical data, we illustrate some of the problems resulting from Hockett’s approach by addressing three specific points—namely arbitrariness and semanticity, cultural transmission, and displacement—and show how the change of perspective allows to overcome those difficulties.},

  abstract = {How prevalent is dyslexia? A definitive answer to this question has been elusive because of the continuous distribution of reading performance and predictors of dyslexia and because of the heterogeneous nature of samples of poor readers. Samples of poor readers are a mixture of individuals whose reading is consistent with or expected based on their performance in other academic areas and in language, and individuals with dyslexia whose reading is not consistent with or expected based on their other performances. In the present article, we replicate and extend a new approach for determining the prevalence of dyslexia. Using model-based meta-analysis and simulation, three main results were found. First, the prevalence of dyslexia is better represented as a distribution that varies as a function of severity as opposed to any single-point estimate. Second, samples of poor readers will contain more expected poor readers than unexpected or dyslexic readers. Third, individuals with dyslexia can be found across the reading spectrum as opposed to only at the lower tail of reading performance. These results have implications for screening and identification, and for recruiting participants for scientific studies of dyslexia.},

We performed spectral-topographical EEG analyses on data from both nights. To assess reproducibility, we used the first 47 consecutive participants (18 with PTSD) for initial discovery and the remaining 31 participants (13 with PTSD) for replication.In the discovery analysis, compared with non-PTSD participants, PTSD participants exhibited (1) reduced delta power (1–4 Hz) in the centro-parietal regions during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and (2) elevated high-frequency power, most prominent in the gamma band (30–40 Hz), in the antero-frontal regions during both NREM and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These findings were consistent across the two study nights, with reproducible trends in the replication analysis. We found no significant group differences in theta power (4–8 Hz) during REM sleep and sigma power (12–15 Hz) during N2 sleep.The reduced centro-parietal NREM delta power, indicating reduced sleep depth, and the elevated antero-frontal NREM and REM gamma powers, indicating heightened central arousal, are potential objective sleep markers of PTSD. If independently validated, these putative EEG markers may offer new targets for the development of sleep-specific PTSD diagnostics and interventions.}

Lenneberg hypothesized that maturational processes similar to those that govern sensory and motor development may also constrain capabilities for normal language acquisition. Our goal, using a bilingual model, was to investigate the hypothesis that maturational constraints may have different effects upon the development of the functional specializations of distinct sub within language. Subjects were 61 adult Chinese/English bilinguals who were exposed to English at different points in development: 1–3, 4–6, 7–10, 11–13, and after 16 years of age. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and behavioral responses were obtained as subjects read sentences that included semantic anomalies, three types of syntactic violations (phrase structure, specificity constraint, and subjacency constraint), and their controls. The accuracy in judging the grammaticality for the different types of syntactic rules and their associated ERPs was affected by delays in second language exposure as short as 1–3 years. By comparison the N400 response and the judgment accuracies in detecting semantic anomalies were altered only in subjects who were exposed to English after 11–13 and 16 years of age, respectively. Further, the type of changes occurring in ERPs with delays in exposure were qualitatively different for semantic and syntactic processing. All groups displayed a significant N400 effect in response to semantic anomalies, however, the peak latencies of the N400 elicited in bilinguals who were exposed to English between 11–13 and {$>$}16 years occurred later, suggesting a slight slowing in processing. For syntactic processing. the ERP differences associated with delays in exposure to English were observed in the morphology and distribution of components. Our findings are consistent w- th the view that maturational changes significantly constrain the development of the neural systems that are relevant for language and, further, that subsystems specialized for processing different aspects of language display different sensitive periods.},

The final picture of each story was either congruous or incongruous with the preceding context. Ss made delayed meaningfulness judgments for each story. Averaged ERPs time-locked to the onset of the final picture were more negative for incongruous than congruous pictures. Two distinct components were sensitive to congruency. The 1st component peaked at 325 ms (N300) and was distributed over central and frontal sites. The 2nd component peaked at 500 ms and also had a centro-frontal maximum but was more widespread than the earlier component (anterior N400). The distinct scalp topographies of these 2 negativities provide strong evidence that the N300 and N400 are separate and distinguishable components. The presence of the N300 in this exclusively pictorial task suggests that the N300 is specific to the semantic processing of non-verbal stimuli and is not due to linguistic mediation. N400 can be modulated by discourse-level coherence manipulations with pictures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2003 APA, all rights reserved).},

For each group the truthfulness judgment required either image generation, a semantic decision, or evaluation of surface characteristics. Results indicate that concrete and abstract words produced similar RTs and ERPs in the surface task, suggesting that postlexical semantic processing is necessary to elicit concreteness effects. In both the semantic and imagery tasks, RTs were shorter for concrete than for abstract words. This difference was greatest in the imagery task. Also, in both of these tasks concrete words elicited more negative ERPs than abstract words between 300 and 550 msec, an effect that was widespread across the scalp.

Two types of plurals were investigated: regular -s plurals (e.g. Karussell-s 'roundabouts') and irregular -(e)n plurals (Muskel-n "muscles'). We compared correct regular and irregular plurals with incorrect ones; the latter had -(e)n on nouns that actually take -s plurals (*Karussell-en), or -s on nouns that require -(e)n (*Muskel-s). ERPs showed different responses to regular and irregular plurals: incorrect irregular plurals (*Muskel-s) elicited a ramp-shaped left frontotemporal negativity, whereas incorrect regulars (*Karussell-en) produced a central phasic negativity with a maximum at 380 ms. This dissociation supports the view that regularly inflected words are processed differently from irregularly inflected ones.},

  abstract = {Background When a second target (T2) is presented in close succession of a first target (T1), people often fail to identify T2, a phenomenon known as the attentional blink (AB). However, the AB can be reduced substantially when participants are distracted during the task, for instance by a concurrent task, without a cost for T1 performance. The goal of the current study was to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of this paradoxical effect. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants successively performed three tasks, while EEG was recorded. The first task (standard AB) consisted of identifying two target letters in a sequential stream of distractor digits. The second task (grey dots task) was similar to the first task with the addition of an irrelevant grey dot moving in the periphery, concurrent with the central stimulus stream. The third task (red dot task) was similar to the second task, except that detection of an occasional brief color change in the moving grey dot was required. AB magnitude in the latter task was significantly smaller, whereas behavioral performance in the standard and grey dots tasks did not differ. Using mixed effects models, electrophysiological activity was compared during trials in the grey dots and red dot tasks that differed in task instruction but not in perceptual input. In the red dot task, both target-related parietal brain activity associated with working memory updating (P3) as well as distractor-related occipital activity was significantly reduced. Conclusions/Significance The results support the idea that the AB might (at least partly) arise from an overinvestment of attentional resources or an overexertion of attentional control, which is reduced when a distracting secondary task is carried out. The present findings bring us a step closer in understanding why and how an AB occurs, and how these temporal restrictions in selective attention can be overcome.},

Error-related events attract more attention, as evidenced by features of event-related scalp potentials previously implicated in selective visual attention (selection negativity, augmented anterior N1). The earliest differences detected occurred around 120 msec after stimulus onset, and distributed source localization (LORETA) indicated that the inferior temporal regions were one source of the earliest differences.

Results from mixed effect regression models showed (a) visual complexity produced small effects in opposing directions for deaf and hearing readers, (b) similar frequency effects, but shifted earlier for deaf readers, (c) more pronounced effects of orthographic neighbourhood density for hearing readers, and (d) more pronounced effects of concreteness for deaf readers. We suggest hearing readers have visual word representations that are more integrated with phonological representations, leading to larger lexically-mediated effects of neighbourhood density. Conversely, deaf readers weight other sources of information more heavily, leading to larger semantically-mediated effects and altered responses to low-level visual variables.},

  abstract = {In studies of event-related potentials (ERPs), short interstimulus intervals (ISIs) are often employed to investigate certain neural or psychological phenomena. At short ISIs, however, the ERP responses to successive stimuli may overlap, thereby distorting the ERP averages. This paper describes a signal processing approach for analyzing the distortion of ERP averages due to such overlap. In general, the distortion is modeled in terms of mathematical convolutions of the ERP waveform elicited by each type of adjacent stimulus with the corresponding distribution in time of those stimuli relative to the averaging epoch. Using this framework, a number of implications of ERP overlap for experimental design and interpretation are examined, with special emphasis given to selective attention paradigms. It is shown that the possibility of confound due to ERP overlap is widespread in short-ISI experiments, and even the widely used procedure of stimulus randomization does not necessarily control for differential distortion of the ERPs to attended versus inattended stimuli. Problems due to ERP overlap can be particularly serious in short-ISI studies that examine how ERPs (and associated perceptual processes) are influenced by the nature of the preceding stimulus (i.e., stimulus sequence effects). A set of algorithms is presented for estimating and removing the residual distortion due to response overlap from recorded ERP averages. The use of these algorithms, collectively termed the Adjacent Response (Adjar) Technique, can alleviate many of the overlaprelated problems that arise when short ISIs are used, thereby enhancing the power of the ERP technique.},

In the non-task condition, the semantic priming effect was observed in a positive wave with a 200-ms peak latency, P200 (P2). In the semantic matching task, where the subjects were required to decide whether or not the repetition and test Kanji characters were semantically related, the priming effect was obtained as the attenuation of the later negative wave N310 (corresponding to N400) for the related test Kanji, instead of P200. The P200 priming effect was interpreted as the semantically related response at the morphological level, whereas the N310 effect was taken as reflection of the semantic-level activation of the semantic associates with the preceding Kanji. The task dependency of semantic priming levels indicated the top-down control in Kanji recognition processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).},

The ideal reference should be the one with zero or constant potential but unfortunately it is well known that no point on the body fulfills this condition. Consequently, more than ten references are used in the present EEG-ERP studies. This diversity seriously undermines the reproducibility and comparability of results across laboratories. A comprehensive review accompanied by a brief communication with rigorous derivations and notable properties (Hu et al. Brain Topogr, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10548-019-00706-y) is thus necessary to provide application-oriented principled recommendations. In this paper current popular references are classified into two categories: (1) unipolar references that construct a neutral reference, including both online unipolar references and offline re-references. Examples of unipolar references are the reference electrode standardization technique (REST), average reference (AR), and linked-mastoids/ears reference (LM); (2) non-unipolar references that include the bipolar reference and the Laplacian reference. We show that each reference is derived with a different assumption and serves different aims. We also note from (Hu et al. 2019) that there is a general form for the reference problem, the ‘no memory’ property of the unipolar references, and a unified estimator for the potentials at infinity termed as the regularized REST (rREST) which has more advantageous statistical evidence than AR. A thorough discussion of the advantages and limitations of references is provided with recommendations in the hope to clarify the role of each reference in the ERP and EEG practice.},

The results from four lexical decision experiments indicate that the joint effects of semantic priming and word frequency are critically dependent upon differences in the vocabulary knowledge of the participants. Specifically, across two Universities, additive effects of the two variables were observed in means, and in RT distributional analyses, in participants with more vocabulary knowledge, while interactive effects were observed in participants with less vocabulary knowledge. These results are discussed with reference to [Borowsky, R., \&amp; Besner, D. (1993). Visual word recognition: A multistage activation model.

Notwithstanding challenges to the automatic encoding view, we believe this empirical generalization remains valid today. Additionally, we describe recent examples of findings from research on language processing and statistical reasoning that add to earlier evidence of the critical contribution of frequency knowledge to cognitive and social functioning. Finally, we note that, in a number of respects, the broader intellectual climate in psychology today is more consistent with our approach to memory encoding than was the intellectual climate of the 1970s.

  abstract = {The most influential theory of learning to read is based on the idea that children rely on phonological decoding skills to learn novel words. According to the self-teaching hypothesis, each successful decoding encounter with an unfamiliar word provides an opportunity to acquire word-specific orthographic information that is the foundation of skilled word recognition. Therefore, phonological decoding acts as a self-teaching mechanism or ‘built-in teacher’. However, all previous connectionist models have learned the task of reading aloud through exposure to a very large corpus of spelling–sound pairs, where an ‘external’ teacher supplies the pronunciation of all words that should be learnt. Such a supervised training regimen is highly implausible. Here, we implement and test the developmentally plausible phonological decoding self-teaching hypothesis in the context of the connectionist dual process model. In a series of simulations, we provide a proof of concept that this mechanism works. The model was able to acquire word-specific orthographic representations for more than 25 000 words even though it started with only a small number of grapheme–phoneme correspondences. We then show how visual and phoneme deficits that are present at the outset of reading development can cause dyslexia in the course of reading development.},

  abstract = {Human language shows combinatoriality in its phonology (both in speech and in sign language) and its grammar, while both types appear to be absent in the communication systems of our closest evolutionary relatives. In this article, we observe that productive combinatoriality is difficult to evolve, because it requires multiple components to be put in place simultaneously for it to function. To understand how it nevertheless evolved in human language, we focus on combinatoriality in phonology, for which most evidence is available. We discuss findings and theories from three domains: linguistics (descriptive, experimental and corpus linguistics), comparative biology (including some fossil indicators) and (computer) models. We tentatively conclude that many of the biological prerequisites for combinatorial phonology and compositional semantics are shared with other animals, but that a uniquely human pressure for large vocabularies and uniquely human processes of cultural evolution are key in understanding the origins of combinatoriality in language.},
