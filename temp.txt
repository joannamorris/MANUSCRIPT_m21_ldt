The process is so rapid and automatic that for very good readers, recognizing a word is only minimally influenced by context.  Lexical quality determines the extent to which for a given word, its orthographic represention rapidly activates its phonological and semantic representation as well. 


critical, specific determi- nant of written language proficiency is an ‘‘expert lexicon’’ characterized by precise, redundant, lexical representations that support eYcient, autono- mous, lexical retrieval 

comprehension of written text obviously involves more than just recognizing words: it depends on knowledge about grammar, word meanings and the world that is not directly available in the text.


Effiecient reading requires that readers establish word-specific orthographic representations
 the rapid retrieval of a  word’s phonological and semantic information from memory based on a brief exposure to its orthographic representation. \citep{rastlePlaceMorphologyLearning2019, castlesHowDoesOrthographic2006}. Rapid and reliable retrieval is  facilitated by high-quality semantic, phonological and orthographic \citep{perfettiLexicalQualityRevisited2017} representations, where '
